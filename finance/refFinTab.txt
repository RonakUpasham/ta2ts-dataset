Conversely, cash flow from investing activities exhibited volatility, with a significant negative spike of -$6,132 million in 2022. Financing activities showed similar fluctuations, with a notable increase in cash inflows in 2022 and 2023. Despite these fluctuations, the net change in cash varied widely, ranging from a decrease of -$324.58 million in 2022 to an increase of $314.49 million in 2023, reflecting the dynamic financial landscape the company navigated during this period.
From 2018 to 2021, company exhibited a consistent growth trajectory in its revenue, climbing from $1,813 million to $2,659 million. Despite this revenue increase, the company experienced a fluctuation in its expenses, reaching a peak of $2,131 million in 2020 before decreasing to $2,089 million in 2021. Consequently, the operating profit margin fluctuated, reaching its highest at 86.78% in 2018 and stabilizing at 81.34% in 2021. Similarly, the net profit margin experienced variability, peaking at 22.31% in 2018 and gradually stabilizing around 13.03% in 2021. Earnings per share (Diluted) followed a similar pattern, reflecting the company's financial performance per outstanding share, while dividends per share remained constant at $0.00 throughout the period, indicating a consistent dividend policy or potential reinvestment strategies.
From 2018 to 2021, the company experienced growth in total assets, rising from $20.38 billion to $30.29 billion, primarily driven by increases in both current and non-current assets. However, there was a slight decrease in current assets in 2019 followed by a recovery in subsequent years. Total liabilities also rose during this period, climbing from $17.97 billion to $27.30 billion, with both current and non-current liabilities seeing consistent growth. Despite this, the company managed to maintain a stable equity position, with total equity fluctuating but remaining relatively steady around $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The debt-to-equity ratio increased over the years, indicating a higher reliance on debt financing compared to equity. The book value per share mirrored this trend, reflecting the company's financial health and value per share for investors.
A striking fetaure of the data obtained from the table is the minimum amount of net profit margin the company has been making from the year 2019 onwards. The company had been sustaining on only 1.07% of net profit from the year 2019 onwards, post which it has made even lesser profit in the year 2020. The net profit margin gap massively increased in the year 2021-2022 with a net increase of 7%. Thus the numbers show mixed variation and it is prominent that the company has been able to increase its net worth in the market in the past two years. Revenue generation has been in full swing and the company has made its highest revenues in the year 2023 with 35823 Cr. Rs. Thus, the company does have good future prospects if it aligns certain strategies with the competitive market scenario and gains the confidence of its shareholders.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company in the year 2022, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself that year. There is a greater scope of potential growth as there is no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company had significantly decreased in the year 2021 reaching 7516 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had less debt to finance its operations efficiently. However the obligations of the company in recent years has increased and the liabilities have touched the 15173 Cr. Rs. mark. A positive outlook of the company is presented by the steady growth of equity over the years which might have resulted from selling shares of stocks. Thus the company has grown significantly over the period and is in a stable position in the rapidly developing market.
The table shown displays cash flow trends of a company over the span of 2019-2023. The change in net cash is spontaneous. The company had always been running low in terms of making cash flow from investing activities which has further seen a steep decline in the year 2023 where it touched -2480 Cr. Rs. This has resulted in huge deviations. The company might have invested more during the period but has not been able to gather enough returns from the same. The segment of cash flow from operating activities has seen slight ups and downs over the years, but has grown by a higher margin in 2023 where it steadily reached 3096 Cr. Rs. This lays emphasis on the fact that the company has been successful in generating enough cash from its core operations in the past year which will allow it to sustain its day-to-day activities. Overall, the company's net cashflow curve shows a steadily increasing trend which is a sign of stability for the company in the long run.
The reports obtained from the table demonstrate a positive upward curve in revenue generation over the years from 2019-2023. The company has reached its maximum revenues in the past year touching 36817 Cr. Rs. and has been doing good in terms of maintaining a steady EBITDA count. The company has also been instrumental in lowering its expenses to as low as 14432 Cr. Rs. in the year 2021 . While the net profit margin shows a slight dip over the years, the company is trying hard to increase its profit in the past two years. The earnings per share has reached 80.49 Rs which is indeed a good news for its shareholders. Investors should hold optimistic prospects as the dividends per share value is on the rise too.
The data obtained from the balance sheet shows fluctuations in the total asset value of the company from 2019-2021. With the assets going down, the company seems to have faced liquidity challenges or operational downfall. It depicts a dip in the growth of the company's resources which might have affected its revenue generation margins. However the company has paced up with the competitive market over the recent years and stands at 73883 Cr. Rs. in terms of its total assets. Having strong current assets is essential for a company to meet its short-term debt obligations and the company looks quite stable from that perspective too. Growth in equity over the years eye to the fact that the company has been able to curtail its operating expenses over the years which is important in the long run. The book value of the company is also on the upward curve which proves the financial stability of the company.
A close look at the cash flow statistics obtained from the table throws light on the fact that the company has seen a varying trend in the opening amount of its cashflow balance over the years. The cash flow from its operating activities have seen tremendous decrease over the years until 2021 when it reached its lowest point at -8517 Cr. Rs. In the following years, the company has struggled to elevate the numbers but has seen itself at an even lower point in the year 2023. This proves that the company has encountered significant capital expenditures and needs to push brakes on external investments. The company is performing fairly well in maintaining a consistent rate of cash inflow from its operating activities which will help the company to maintain a profitable balance in the future. The year 2021 had witnessed a good margin of cash raised from financing post which the company seems to have gone into debt or has involved itself in stock buybacks. Thus, the overall scenario does not provide a very stable picture as the net cash flow is still on the negative side of the graph and a sustainable position of the company cannot be ensured.
The financial situation of the company is not at a very fruitful state as is evident from the recent decrease in the net profit margin in the year 2023. The net profit margin has gone down to 4.52% and the company's share values have gone down to 47.1 Rs. consequently. This is a matter of sheer concern for shareholders and brings up questions on the future prospects of the company. While revenue generation has been maintained on the go, the company still has to reach higher goals of stabilizing its overall operating profit margin in order to gain the trust of its shareholders.
The information drawn from the given table represents the bank statement of a company and shows the huge financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2018 to 2023, finally touching 14142 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands as low as 0.01 which reduces the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting a tremendous positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run.
The statistics obtained from the data shown proves that the company has faced marked decline in terms of net cashflow in the last year when it touched -7110 Cr. Rs. This definitely puts a question on the financial flexibility of the company in recent times. While the company has been able to maintain a fair amount of increasing opening balance every year, the total cash flow from external activities does not stand at par with it. The trends in the cash flow from operating activities shows positive numbers throughout untill 2023, where the value has tremendously dipped to -1235 Cr. Rs. As a result, there is a need to adopt better strategies to manage the accumulation of cash from internal and external operations. The company has been the witness of significant divestments in the past five years and it is noteworthy that the value is declining by a steeper margin in recent years. Over the years the debt has increased too which has impacted the overall financial position of the company in the market.
A mark of concern for all shareholders of this company is the fact that the profitability and earnings per share of the company have significantly dipped  from 48.47 Rs. in 2021 to  4.01 Rs. in 2023. This raises questions on the future financial stability of the company and needs to be monitored in the long run. Revenue has increased over the years but at a slow pace. Expenses have increased hand in hand and needs to be curtailed in order to increase the net profit margin. The efficiency of its workforce has been maintained over the years and is a positive sign. Overall, the data shows ups and downs and it is imperative that the company makes reorganisational steps to reduce its overheads and in turn, amplify its profits.
While the total assets of the company as seen a gradual upsurge over the years 2019-2023, the increase in liabilities of the company have gone hand in hand and by a higher margin. This indicates that the company still has a long way to go to clear off owing cash to its creditors and this might have put some pressure on the company in recent times. The book value has drastically reduced in 2023 and has touched 22.22 Cr. Rs. , the lowest in the past 5 years and this raises concerns. However the common stock value as of 2023 stands as high as 359.57 Cr. Rs. which reflects investor expectations that the company will be profitable in the future.
The data shown in the table depicts an optimistic view towards the company's financial status. The net profit margin of the company is rising steadily over the past 5 years and so is the earnings per share. It is a commendable job on the company's part to have been able to maintain an upward growth in the competitive market scenario. Revenue generation has been in full swing over the years and has touched the highest point in 2023 at 30,201 Cr. Rs.  While expenses have risen to and peaked in 2023 at 24,839 Cr. Rs. the company has been capable of balancing the numbers resulting in a profitable state. Thus, the company might continue to flourish in the market with sheer prosperity.
The trends in total assets posed by the company in the past five years gives a spectacular impression of the marked financial stability of the company. It depicts that the company has been able to keep up its revenue generation and has improved its net worth. While the company has also been hung on a good amount of liabilities, the amount of monetary dealings it owes to its creditors including accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued expenses have increased. But the company also stands at a higher risk to lenders and investors because a significant amount of its potential growth is supported through borrowing and as a result the debt to equity value stands at 83.99 Cr. Rs. as of 2023.
From the given table we can clearly analyse the statistics of the company from the year 2019 to 2023. The data obtained from the table portrays a clear picture of the company's cash flow statements highlighting the drop in cash flow from operating activities in the past year by a huge margin. The company has touched -24029 Cr. Rs. from operating activities which is definitely not a positive sign for a sustainable development in the future. The net change in cash observed over the years has seen a drastic increase in the year 2020, which shows that the company had been in a stable position and had been making good enough profits. The net change in cash values have gone down in the following years and the company had reached its lowest point as that of 2022. Overall the company is not performing very great in terms of strategic investments as most of its data depict significant capital expenditures. However it has been able to maintain a consistency in cash flow from financial activities in the past 2 years which is a positive sign that the company is not in debt.
The financial reports of the company from the given table show variation and ups and downs in numbers. Over the years from 2019-2021 the company has been maintaining  its revenues in the same range until it reached 3907 Cr. Rs. in the year 2022. Expenses have increased proportionally and so has the net profit. In the year 2023, the company has witnessed a slight dip in the net profit range and consequently its operating margin. However the increase in the value of earnings per share from 481.03 Rs. in 2022 to 512.15 Rs. in 2023 gives some hope for shareholders and investors about the future prospects of the company.
An overall view of data obtained from the given balance sheet depics that the company's assets have been increasing at a steady rate over the years and thus the company has adequate resources to finance itself for future activities. There is also an increase in current assets with time which the company might soon convert to cash. This is needed to support the company in case of short term debts and indicate liquidity improvement. With the book value of the company on the rise, the financial stability of the company is maintainedat par and shows a positive outlook.
The statistics obtained from the table depict the cash flow picture of a company in the past 5 years. The company has seen drastic decrease in its operating cash balance in the year 2020 which points to the fact that the company had not been in its stable state by a huge margin. Over the years it has tried to escalate its revenues and touch an opening cash balance of 88.97 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. The company has not been making a profit margin from its operational activities and has dropped low drastically in the year 2023. Thus the company has not been persistently involved in generating cash flow from its core operations which might make it difficult for the company to sustain itself. The same trend is noticed in its financing activities cash flow which indicates that the company has reached enough cash from issuing stocks and borrowing money. As the net change in cash over the years has seen tremendous fluctuations, it is notable that the company is ideally not in a stable position to accumulate enough cash and can hence face liquidity challenges.
It is to be noted from the given table that the company has been instrumental in maintaining a good value of revenue over the years and the numbers have prosperously increased over the years. Thus it indicates that the customers or consumers of its products and services have been showing a positive response. While the company peaked in terms of operational efficiency in the year 2021, it faced a slight decline in the year 2022 post which it steadily regained its position. Overall, the data shows mixed numbers and should be monitored in the long run to come to a conclusion regarding any financial aspect of the company.
With the variation in the equity values on the rise over the years 2019-2022, the company is seen to have maintained a high financial leverage to sustain itself for a prospective future. It also throws light on its effective business strategy that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. However as of the last year, equity has slightly dipped to 15744 Cr. Rs. which means that the company is using more equity and less debt to finance the purchase of assets. It is though appreciative to note that the company has been able to bring down its liabilities over the years thus indicating that it has been successful in meeting all the mandatory financial obligations it owed to its creditors which is a sign of marked financial stability. The book value of the company has also slightly dipped in the last  year which hints at a possible change in the prevailing market conditions or a reduced market value of its assets.
From the given table it is evident that the company has gone down in terms of maintaining its open cash balance over the years and thus the trends show a steep decline. Though the company has tried to maintain a positive outlook towards maintaining its operating cash flow, the numbers are quite appreciative as compared to other companies during the same period. It is hence proven that the company generates cash from its core operations and day to day activities which helps to maintain a balance in its net cash change. The amount of profit the company makes from its investing activities has decreased in the past 4 years. So it is clear that the company might have been debt or into rebuying of stocks. All though the company has been running negative in terms of the net change in cash, it has made an effort to pull up its socks and make a positive change in its net cash value in the year 2023 which is a good sign for all its investors.
With expenses on the rise, it is notable from the given table that the company is struggling to maintain a stable margin of profit from its increasing revenues. It is necessary that the company makes an attempt at cost effective measures so as to have the profit curve on the rise. While its overall market worth has increased with time and its earnings per share have touched the 23.14 Rs. mark, it needs to take measures to enhance its overall profit and have a stable hold in the rapidly developing market. It is however a point of attraction for shareholders and investors and should be looked at with optimism.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the total financial stability of the company over the years in terms of its net assets possessed. The notable rise in assets over the years indicate that the company has excelled in revenue generation and has a pretty positive hold on the current market. The increase in total liabilities have gone hand in hand and the company seems to have kept up well with the total accrued expenses. Investors shall have a devoted interest towards the company as is evident form its increasing stocks value. The company has also kept itself away from debt and brought down the det to equity value to 0.27 , which is a sign of marked progress.
The statistical reports of the company from its financial cash flow data obtained from the table depicts the consistent increase in the opening cash balance of the company in the past 5 years. The year 2023 has seen a striking increase in its opening cash balance. The company has maintained a consistent cash flow from its operating activities until the year 2021, post which the graph has likely gone down. This indicates that the company has been able to generate comparatively lesser profit from its day to day activities. The company is also under the influence of excess capital expenditures or investments. From the data obtained from the cash flow investing activities we can conclude that the company had been running really low in terms of maintaining profitable investments. In the year 2023, the cash flow from investing activities has reached the lowest point of -875.74Cr. Rs. which focuses on the need to reconsider its investing strategies and investment choices. It is a positive sign that the company has not been in debt recruitment in the past two years which will help the company to prosper significantly. However the financial flexibility of the company has seen an overall dip as of 2023, when the net change in cash flow is observed to be -41.04 Cr. Rs. This might indicate liquidity challenges that the company has been recently facing.
The data obtained from the table reflects a mixed variation over the five years in terms of financial stability of the company. The revenue data shows ups and downs but with slight variations, overall within the same range. It is notable that the operating profit margin of the company has decreased conspicuously 2021 onwards and has been on the decline till date. This might eye to a necessity to cut down its management costs or cost of labour. Since operational efficiency has decreased too as is evident from the EBITDA values, there is a nee dfor reconstruction of its ideas to channelise the company and its growth in the upward direction. The company faced a bad time in the year 2021 - 2022 and has seen a decrease in its earnings per share. however, it is struggling to increase the value and settle in the existing market.
The data fetched from the balance sheet table is indicative of the financial numbers of the company which gives us an impression of the well-being of the company in the current market scenario. It provides a clear picture of a variation in the total assets owned by the company which might depict that the company has undergone periodic gains and losses in business and profitability. It is to be noted that the debt to equity ratio of the company has seen a steep upward graph over the years which is not a positive sign. Thus we can say that irrespective of the common stock values going up, the company is at a higher risk to lenders and investors because it suggests that the company is financing a significant amount of its potential growth through borrowing
The statistics of the company in the past 5 years is clearly depicted from its cash flow table given. It is to be taken into account that the company had been performing exceptionally poor in terms of maintaining a stability in its core operations. In 2019, it reached -11643 Cr. Rs. Over the years it has been event to stabilize its profit and make revenue from its core operations. However this indicates that the cash flow from investing activities is still on the negative side, which means that the company has not been making complete and full investments. Though the situation has become better in the past 1 year, the company still has a long way to go in order to make profit from investing activities. The company is still in debt as is depicted via the negative value of its cash flow from financial activities. Hence overall the net change in cash had drastically gone down in 2022, post which it has seen some improvement in net cash flow in the past year.
The statistics shown in the above table highlight the financial figures of the company in the past five years. The company has been performing exceptionally well in maintaining an overall upward growth in its operational profit margin which is indespensable for the prosperity of the company in the long run. While the organisation faced a major decline in the net profit margin in the year 2021 when it touched 3.25%, it has been steadily catching up with the competitive market and has increased its profit margin by a huge leap to 35.73% in 2023. The company's earnings per shares have also witnessed a massive upscale reaching 74.71 Rs. from 13.30 Rs. and throws light on the fact that the company has been able to establish a good worth in the market.
The statistics obtained from the given balance statement table is indicative of the profitable financial status of the company over the last 5 years which is evident from an upward graph of its total assets. The current and non current assets have thus seen a similar trend. They typically include long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment and is less liquid in nature. An increasing liability curve suggests the companyâ€™s debt obligations have grown over the period. The non current liabilities of the company have seen a similar trend which points to the fact that the company may have taken on more long-term debts with every coming year to finance its operations. Overall, the company is at a prominent stage in its development and has future scopes of expansion.
The trend in the overall opening balance over the years shows an increasing curve which highlights that the company has been maintaining a fairly good amount of revenue to sustain its daily needs. The year 2021 has seen a huge downfall in its cashflow from operating activities, which might indicate that the company had been running low in terms of efficiency and had made lesser cash out of its core operations. However in recent years it has been able to compensate for the loss and has made enough profit from its operational sector which is indespensable for a stable foothold. Investments made by the company have not resulted in sufficient results as is evident from the negative values of cash flow obtained form investing activities. It is noteworthy that the company has recovered itself from the state of debt it was in 2020, when it fell off to -287.12 Cr. Rs. and has been able ot maintain a positive value with some variations. With the net change in cash reaching -35.20 Cr. Rs. as of 2023, the company seems to have been struggling lately to maintain a balance between the net inflow and outflow of cash.
The company data from the table shows a beautifully rising revenue growth curve in the past 5 years with the company touching 54,053 Cr. Rs. revenue in the year 2023. The operating profit margin faced slow growth until 2021 post which it has been seen to be slowly declining. While shareholders have found a good deal with this company, it needs to be monitored for future variations in numbers. Overall net profit margin has been actively maintained by the company and shows minor variations. It is imperative that the company balances its revenues and its expenses in order to generate an upward profit margin with time.
It is prominent from the table that the company has been able to maintain a steady upward graph in terms of its financial numbers over the years 2019-2023 as is depicted from the upward curve of its total assets over the years and its increasing book value. Shareholders have a good profit with the company as the rate of common stock value as reached to as high as 153 Cr. Rs. which is a marked sign of the company's increased net worth over the years. The debt to equity ratio over the years have seen a dip lately which is a sign of positivity. Lenders and Investors shall lean towards this company which has a lower debt-to-equity ratio.
The net change in cash is an important parameter which depicts the overall financial strength of a company and its capability to sustain itself in the long run. It is remarkable how the company has been able to recover itself from the state of negative cash change in the year 2021 when it reached the bottom line of -1927 Cr. Rs. The earnings from operating activities has been on the rise and gives us a positive outlook about the company. The company needs to work more on strategic investments in order to grow the numbers generated from its investing activities. This would act as a catalyst in increasing the net cash flow by a greater margin. It seems like the company has also involved itself in stock buybacks or is under the pressure of repayment of debts as the values from its financing activities have drastically inclined to -6227 Cr. Rs. over the years.
A striking point to be observed from the given table is the increase in the company's net profit margin in the year 2023. Profit margin increased from 3.95% to 6.41%  and shows signs of advancement of the company. The revenues are at par with the growth of the company and it is evident that in recent years the company has been performing better than before. Efficiency in operational aspects have also taken a sudden hike in 2023 and is indicative of upcoming future prospects of the company to strengthen its working proficiency. Currently the company is at a lucrative state for shareholders and investors  and shows signs of betterment in the future.
The bigger picture of the company's highs and lows can be clearly depicted from the given balance sheet statement. The company has been sustaining itself well in the past five years and has made a fair increase in the total asset values. The trend in liabilities has seen ups and downs over the years which might indicate fluctating market scenarios and the increased need for the company to depend on its investors for monetary and operational supplies. The book value of the company has touched as high as 93 Cr. Rs. as of 2022 but has seen a drastic drop in the year 2023 which raises concerns on the decreased market value of its assets and needs to be monitored.
The data fetched from the table shows concerning numbers of the net change in cash as the company seems to have touched the -80.91 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023. This highlights a dropdown in the company profits and is a risk in the path of sustainable growth. The opening cash balance of the company has been overall in the same range, so it is needless to say that the company is doing moderately fine in terms of revenue generation every consistent year. The positive value of cash flow generated from operating activities depicts that the company has been able to accumulate cash from its prominent operations on a daily basis and is on the positive side. A lot of work is still needed on the investment front as the cash from investing activities is on the decline. This emphasises the need to reform its investment plans to maintain a higher net change in cash.
It is clearly visible from the table that the financial reports of the company have not proved to be lucrative enough for its investors and will not attract shareholders likewise. The company has been maintaining steady growth in revenues over the years but has been a victim of an imbalance in the higher rate of increasing overhead costs and expenditires. As a result what follows is sheer loss and the company net profit margin has been on the decline. Though the compaany has performed a little better in the year 2023 comparitively, its net profit still stands at a negative 19.08% which is prominently not the sign of a sustainable company with future prospects. The same trend is observed in its operational and functional efficiency as a result of which it is imperative to conclude that the company is on the path of a steep decline.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2019-2023. The burning rate of total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. However it is a key point that the book value of the company has gone done by a great margin over the years 2019 to 2023 from 128804 Cr. Rs. to 121.66 Cr. Rs. This needs to be analysed as it might hint to a fluctuating market scenario or likewise. Stock rates of this company have gone up essentially which is a parameter that might attract shareholders in the long run.
The statistical reports of the company as is obtained form the cash flow table lays emphasis on the fact that the company has been struggling to maintain an optimum level of cash from operating activities. The negative numbers are a proof to the fact that the company is spending more cash than it is generating from its core business operations. This can be concerning and requires further analysis to understand the root cause and potential implications. The cash from investing activities has gone up in the year 2023 to 46.41 Cr. Rs. after a steep range of negative numbers in 2021-2022. Thus the company seems to have pushed brakes on its investments and is on its way to tackle liquidity challenges. Overall, the company has to make significant effort in maintaining better core operation standards which has resulted in the higher variation in the net change in cash over the years.
The data obtained from the table clearly reveals that the company has been struggling over the years to make a stable proifit margin. With running at a loss in the year 2019 at -0.05%, it tried hard to make slight variation in the profit values and made a profit of 1.41%. However it dipped to -0.07% again in the year 2021 post which it has been progressing with higher positive numbers. The growth in profit in the last 2 years has been slow and gradual, but it is noteworthy that the company has recovered itself from the state of loss. It has also been able to maintain a steady range of net operational margin over the years. There can be no questions on the operational efficiency of the company though as is evident from growing values of EBITDA. Shareholders can hold some hope as the earnings per share of the company seem to have risen in the past 2 years as compared to the negative range it was initially in.
The company has been maintaining a steady gain of revenues over the years 2019-2022 as is evident from the increasing values of total assets over the years. The total asset value as of 2023 stands at a striking 10713 Cr. Rs. mark which is an excellent transition. The company might have recently revamped its strategic plans or modified its revenue generation skills to have reached out to a wider market base in the past year. The values of liquid assets have also seen a constant rise with an increase in the current liabilities of the company. They are the claims of outsiders on the company's assets and need to be reduced as soon as possible. Stocks have risen with the trending market and this gives scope for the company to attract investors and shareholders for a better financial strength in the future.
The financial reports obtained from the table depict that the company had reached its peak point in the year 2021 where the net change in cash value stood at 203.99 Cr. Rs., the highest in the past 5 years. In 2021, the company faced a massive decline as the net cash succumbed to -215.83 Cr. Rs. showing marked decline in the prosperity of the company. The company might have been involved in stock repayments or buy backs as a result of which the cash obtained from these financial activities witnessed a major decline. Though the company has tried to pull up its socks to enhance the net cash flow margin in the past year, it is running into debt as is noted from the drastic low in cash flow from its financial activities.
The table depicts the financial reports of a company in the last five years between 2019-2023. It is prominent that the company is definitely showing good progress over the years and has been able to maintain a sustainable value for its financial numbers. The company has made good enough revenues over the years with a steady rise and has been capable of balancing its expenses too. Thus, the net profit margin of the company is rising over the years by conspicuous numbers which is a sign of prosperity for the company. It has also been a sure choice for shareholders with its earnings per share touching 119.59 rs. in 2023. Investors can look forward to future prospects with this company as the dividends per share values are on the rise too.
It is significant from the data of the following table that the company has been able to increase its revenue generation strategies over the years and has expanded its assets on a large scale. A marked increase in total asset account the company has successfully touched the 56066 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023. Liability of the company stands at a fairly high level followed by some current liabilities. The company has a higher margin of non current liabilities which eye to long term Investment plans for the company. It does not affect the liquid cash inflow. As we see an upward growth in the total equity of the company, it represents a positive approach towards the financial prospects of the company. The company has also been able to maintain a consistent amount of shares which makes it gain the confidence of shareholders who will also be attracted by the higher book value touched in the last.
The table demonstrates the ups and downs in net cash flow for a company over the span of 5 years from 2019-2023. In the past year, the company has faced a rapid decline in its core operational profit which has resulted in a decline of the numbers to -6504 Cr. Rs. However this number has been balanced by the cash flow from its financing activities by a huge margin. The company has revived its status in the past one year from 2022-2023 which is indeed a positive sign that the status of the company is showing a marked improvement. Though the trends show consistent values, the scenario as of 2023 shows a brighter side of the picture which is necessary for the development of the company in the future.
The revenue curve for the company data displayed is a U-shaped curved between 2019-2023. The expenses show a similar trend in values. The company had faced a tremendous fall in the year 2021 when its net profit margin dropped to -8.36% as opposed to the previous year value of 7.26%. Over the years from 2022, it has been able to pull up its socks and make a steady growth in its net profit margin. It has been showing commendable results in balancing its operating profit margin irrespective of the rising expenses. With earnings per share increasing by a huge margin in the year 2023, shareholders will be highly moved by the variation and shall make better profits. It will be worthwhile if the company is able to sustain this growth curve in the near future in order to have a stable hold in the market.
It is remarkable from the given balance sheet of the company that there has been a significant fluctuation in the total revenue generation of the company in the year 2019 to 2023. The company has, as a result, witnessed a decline in the total asset value in the year 2020. It has not been able to totally compensate for the loss in the recent years. Current assets of the company are fairly low which slightly raises a question that the company needs to work on maintaining a short term in hand cash flow in order to support its operating activities. The total liabilities of the company have also gone down with time which is a good sign but the amount of current liabilities that the company holds have increased in recent times. There has been significant decline in the total equity possessed by the company which is a concern for the company in the long run. It has been able to maintain the stock on a consistent range and can still gain the confidence and support of investors as it has touched a higher book value as per the recent trends.
The reports of cash flow data from the table show positive numbers for the net income from operating activities which indicates that the company has been able to maintain a good standard of its core operations and ensures efficiency. However, the trend in cash flow from investing activities shows a steep decline reaching negative numbers which points to the fact that the company has been investing too much on external and internal resources. This has dropped the net cash flow by a deep margin in the year 2023. In order to generate an upward net cash flow curve, it is necessary that the company curtails its worthless investments and channelises its strategies towards an effective investment plan.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 5 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing remarkably well in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years which hints at the fact that the company has been judiciously investing on its strategies and management plans. Though the operating profit margin is on the rise, it has not been able to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin too. In the year 2020, net profit margin faced a severe low of 6.85% post which the company has been aiming at enhancing the numbers strategically. As a result, it has been able to touch the 11.50% mark as of 2023. Overall the company is currently at a steady phase and needs to be making gradual improvements at the same pace to ensure the stability of the company and to gain a good trust of its prospective investors.
The given table is a representation of the balance sheet of a company from 2019 to 2023. The company has seen a straight increase in its total equity which throws light on the current stability and financial performance of the company. Overall the table gives a fairly positive outlook about the company as we see an increase in its net market profit. The common stock values are increasing at slow but gradual rate. The book value of the company has also increased in the current times which means that the company has been able to maintain a balance between its total assets and liabilities generated. As the total assets have been constantly on the rise, the total liabilities have seen a fluctuating trend. The company still holds some amount of current liabilities which can be converted into cash in the next one year and can help the company build a better base for the future.
The data obtained from the table gives us a clear picture of the company which has been able to maintain its opening cash balance steadily from the year 2020-2023. Though the company had been starting with an opening cash balance of 0.10 Cr. Rs. as of 2019, the company has been able to pull its socks up and keep in pace with the current market scenario. It is to be noted that the cash flow from operating activities is also quite a good positive number which indicates that the company generates enough cash from its core operations. Though this value has comparatively decreased in the past 2 years and overall net positive value is still a good outlook. The cash flow from investing activities had highly dipped as of the year 2021 where it touched - 502.95 Cr. Rs. but the company has tried to improve its status in the following years. However the company has a long way to go in order to maintain a steady cash flow from financing activities as the current negative values might be an indication of debt repayment. Overall the net cash balance has been positive but has comparatively gone down as compared to what it was 5 years back.
From the statistical report of the financial figures shown in the table, we can draw a conclusion about the company's net progress over the years. The year 2021 saw a major downfall in the net profit margin of the company when the net profit margin touch 6.23%. Revenues dipped by a slight value as well. The company seems to have been going through a rough time as is evident from the EBITDA values that point to a decreased operational efficiency. The company might not have had the necessary market required to sell across its product to the customers. However post 2022 the company is slowly progressing towards attaining a higher profit margin. It is imperative to note that shareholders still continue to enjoy benefits at a rate of 400.37 Rs. earnings per share from the company which is indeed a positive response.
The statistics obtained from the balance sheet of the given company reveals certain figures about the overall financial stability of the company in the years 2019 to 2023. There has been a gradual increase in the total assets posed by the company until 2022 post which the company has seen a slight decrease in its total assets in the last one year. Current assets of the company show similar trends and reveals that the company has a fairly good amount of cash in hand in order to support its operating activities. The non concurrent assets of the company through light on the long term investment plans that it might have. As the liabilities continue to go on the rise the company still has some work to be done in order to repay what it owes to its creditors. Similar fluctuating variation has been observed in the total equity value which hints at the fact that the year 2023 might have seen a significant decline in the market revenue or market scenario. The company still has a good hold on its stock values and shows a very little ratio of debt to equity which puts the company in a fairly stable position.
The table shown in the image is a clear demonstration of the highly fluctuating cash flow values of a company in the past 5 years. Though the company had been progressively heading in the years 2020-2022, the year 2023 has seen a drastic downfall in the net change in cash flow. This might indicate liquidity challenges faced by the company. It is also to be kept in mind that the company is making a loss in terms of cash flow from financial activity and the values have touched highly poor margins. - 979.67 Cr. Rs. as of 2023 is a point of concern for the investors and the company likewise. It is a good sign that the company has been able to maintain and upward curve in terms of cash flow from operating activities. This highlights that the company has enough wealth to sustain its daily activities too.
The financial reports of the company show almost not much deviation in the revenue generation curve over the years. The company has been able to make a striking hike in the net profit margin in the year 2022 when the net profit margin reached 51.36%. However, the company has still been on the decline in the past year. Expenses have been maintained at a consistent range too, which throws light on the calculated strategic plans of the company with respect to expenditures. The net worth of the company in the market is also seen to be fluctuating as is prominent from the earnings per share values. The EPS values dipped as low as 5.50 Rs. in the year 2020 following which it touched a good height of 100.04 Rs. in 2022. The company seems to have reached a prosperous state at that phase. However the recent trends show that the company is again dropping down in the year 2023 which is a matter of concern for its shareholders .
The given picture is a table of a balance sheet of a company which helps us to analyse the ups and downs in generation of assets of a company over a period of time. It is clearly depicted from the table that the company has seen slight fluctuations in its total asset value over the years with the least value touching 3115 Cr. Rs. In the year 2021, we see slight increase in total assets but the value had correspondingly decreased the next year. The company holds good amount of liabilities which need to be cleared of. Current assets of the company has been fairly maintained at high rate but has seen variating figures. The company has incurred good amount of monetary support to sustain its day to day operations. The total equity of the company had gradually gone down in the year 2021 when it reached 1478 Cr. Rs. after which the company seems to have pulled up its socks and made an effort to decrease its liability. Thus the company is quite profitable in the market even in its current position and has the support of investors effectively.
The data obtained from the table shows the variation in cash flow values of a company throughout the last 5 years. As is evident from the table, the opening cash balance of the company has been fluctuating in numbers with consistent ups and downs. The cash flow from operating activities had risen up to a high of 810.7 Cr. Rs. in 2022 which is indeed a positive sign for the future development of the company. However the numbers have seen a decline by a huge margin in the year 2023 where it reached 484.23. This might eye to the fact that the company has been making lesser cash than it is spending on its operational sector. A noteworthy aspect for the company is the drastically increasing value of a cash flow from investing activities in the year 2023 after a net negative value. This ensures that the company is making strategic Investments and is on the right track towards making right Investments and taking the right decisions. The cash flow from financing activities has seen a steep decline in the year 2023 when it touched - 1543 Cr. Rs. This is a sign that the company might not have been making enough profit from its overall expenditure and investment. This number needs to be clearly monitored in order to stabilize the company in the long run. This will further impact the trend in net change in cash flow over the years.
The statistical report of the company obtained from the table over the span of past 5 years make it clear that the company had performed terribly poor in the year 2019 when it touched a negative profit margin of - 1.19%. The following year had also seen a drastic decrease in its operational efficiency as the EBITDA values speak, when it touched the baseline of -1,433 Cr. Rs. The company has been successful in escalating its operational efficiency in the year 2021 but faced another fatal blow in the year 2022. Overall the trends in the net profit margin of the company do not pose a much reliable picture. Shareholders might also lose interest in the company as the share values are going as low as 1.18 Rs. as that of 2022. Investors might have to wait for sometime long until the company makes significant progress in terms of net profit and efficiency. The company has still a long way to work on its management and business development approach in order to maintain a sustainable balance in the future.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain an increase in its total equity over the years. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. Current assets of the company has also touched a huge mark of 22248 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company has enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. It has always been on the increase except in 2020 when it witnessed a sudden decline in total assets. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation in the year 2020 or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has been consistent throughout, the book value has seen slow growth which is also a positive sign for the company in the long run. Investors might look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
The data obtained from the table highlights the trending cash flow values of a company in the past 5 Years from 2019 to 2023. The company has been maintaining fairly good revenues throughout the five years as is evident from the highly increasing opening cash balance curve. The company has been running low in terms of generating enough cash flow from its operational sectors. As of 2023, the cash flow from its operating activities has touched - 5855 Cr. Rs. which is a concern on the sustainability of the day-to-day activities of the organisation. Liquid cash flow from financing activities has seen a fluctuating trend since the past 5 years. The company had a tough time in 2019 with -475.65 Cr. Rs. net cash flow which can indicate that the company was facing liquidity challenges. The cash flow had increased by a positive margin in the year 2021 but has fallen down to negative values again in the past two years which might indicate a sheer sign of loss. Though the company has been able to maintain a positive net change in cash until 2022, the company has not been able to maintain a stable financial status in 2023.
The given table shows the data over the past 5 years that demonstrate the financial performance of the company. The numbers are fairly positive and throw light on the company's upward growth. The revenue curve has been tremendously optimistic and so is the enhanced operational efficiency of the company as a whole. The company has been able to maintain an average operating profit margin over the years with slight variation in the year 2022 when it reached 3.63%. In the same year, the net profit margin had also seen a low of 1.78%. This is representative of the fact that the company might have had a hard time to cope with its increasing expenses in the year 2022. With increase in the rate of earnings per share the company has been able to successfully draw the attention of its shareholders and promise them a profitable return. Thus the company is at a fairly good position to proceed with its futuristic plans.
From the given table it is a matter to concentrate on the fact that the company has been making significant progress over the years in terms of total revenue generation, which is evident from the figures of its total assets. The year 2022 has seen an increase in the total asset value by a huge margin when it touched 4277 Cr. Rs. The non current liabilities is a depiction that the company has recently increased its long term investment and thus it relies on external resources for funding. Liabilities of the company has increased with time which needs to be monitored and cut down at the earliest. The company also has a good amount of non current liability in its name which has decreased a little in 2023. This might include long term debt which in the future can put the company at a financial risk. The debt to equity of the company seems to have decreased a little bit with time which is a positive sign as the company is not as highly dependent on its creditors as it was in the past year. Thus the company has been maintaining a good asset margin, but it would be good for it to look into the book value figures and the increasing liabilities to reach a better position in the market.
It is evident from the given picture that the company has been trying hard to make strategic investments in the right areas in the past five years and thus reduce the loss in negative cash flow from investing activities. The margin of revenue earned from cash flow of operating activities has shown steep increase in the past three years. Although the cash flow as of 2023 stands at 725.75 Cr. Rs. ,which has helped in balancing the overall net change in cash. Cash flow from financing activities had drastically gone down in the year 2020 post which it has seen a refreshed status. However in 2023 the cash flow from financing activities has dropped again to -329.62 Cr. Rs. The overall net change in cash has been balanced throughout the past 5 years with minor dips which is an indication of the overall stability and sustainability of the company.
The revenue growth of the company shows positive trends over the past five years with conspicuous increase in its values. Expenses have been on the rise too and the company seems to have been trying hard to  push its limits and maintain a balance between the two. It is to be observed that the company has been running low in terms of its operating profit margin which needs to be addressed immediately to ensure maximum productivity. The net profit margin has been maintained approximately in the same range and has not undergone steep variations. Shareholders have found a suitable spot with its earnings per share reaching 111.53 Rs. as of 2023. Investors with future prospects in the company can plan for their deals as it is at a fruitful position with its higher values of dividends per share.
With time the company has demonstrated varying trends in the different parameters as observed from the given balance sheet table. It is to be noted that the overall assets of the company have been constantly on the rise which is a good sign for the stability of the company. It has certain non current assets which the company might have reserved for long term investments. Thus the company has enough money to sustain itself at the operational level as well as in the near future. However it has been witnessing a liability charge over the years which needs to be brought down at the earliest. The common stock values are maintained overall in the same level and the company might be an attraction for investors at the moment because of its high book value of 504.50 Cr. Rs.  which it reached in the year 2023. The debt to equity value of the company has also seen a light increase in the year 2023 indicating that the company has more of debt to be cleared in the last year
It is needless to point out that the statistics of the company as depicted in the given cash flow table is one with varying numbers. The company has always maintained a high amount of opening cash throughout the past five years. There is a high escalation in the value for cash flow from operating activities as of the past three years. This emphasizes on the fact that the company is able to make good margin of money from its core activities. While the company has a lot of effort to be demonstrated in maintaining a higher value of cash flow from its financing activities, this might be an indication that the company is involving itself in repayment of stocks or buyback of stocks and is thus running into a state of debt. Overall the company has witnessed a positive net change in cash as of 2023, after 2 consistent years of negative values. This is indeed a sign of marked improvement.
The statistical report of the company obtained from the table over the span of past 5 years make it clear that the company had performed terribly poor in the year 2019 when it touched a negative profit margin of - 43.90%. The following year had also seen a drastic decrease in its operational efficiency as the EBITDA values speak, when it touched the baseline of -4,522 Cr. Rs. The company has been successful in escalating its operational efficiency in the following years. Overall the trends in the net profit margin of the company do pose a much reliable picture. Shareholders might also get attracte to its increasing earnings oer share rates. Thus, the company is performing fine in recent times with respect to profit margin and efficiency. It should maintain its upward curve at this pace to maintain a sustainable hold in the market.
The data obtained from the given bank statement sheet is a testament of the fact that the company has seen a drastic improvement in terms of revenue generation and has expanded itself to acquire more and more assets over the years. The highest asset value of the company as that of 2023 stands at 267827 Cr. Rs. The total liabilities of the company have also gone hand in hand and the company has to make a lot of progress in order to cut those down. The total equity of the company seems to have touched a higher margin which throws light on the financial stability of the company with time. Shareholders have found a good profit in this company with its increasing values of stock and book value. The debt to equity stands neutral which is indeed a good sign for the company as it indicates that the company has never been in debt over the years and can  effectively make a firm hold in the rapidly developing market.
In the given picture of the cash flow table of a company across the years 2018 to 2022, we observe varying trends in all cash flow parameters. The company had initially being struggling in generating optimum cash flow growth from its operating activities and had been running in terms of negative value. However in the past 3 years it has been able to pull its socks up and show a positive net cash flow from all operating activities which touched 7233 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has been investing probably too much into the wrong areas as a result of which it has been able to make minimum returns from its investment. While the company has tried to stay consistent with a positive value of financing activity cash flow, the curve has stooped down in the past two years. The company is in an overall good position in terms of the net cash profit it has encountered throughout the year. This trend needs to be maintained in the future in order to ensure the prosperity of the company.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 5 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing remarkably well in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years which hints at the fact that the company has been judiciously investing on its strategies and management plans. The operating profit margin is on the rise, and it has been able to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin too. In the year 2023, net profit margin touched 17.76%, the highest in the last few years. The company needs to follow this growth and aim at enhancing the numbers strategically. As a result, it has been able to touch the 20,248 Cr. Rs. revenue mark as of 2023. Overall the company is progressing at a steady phase and will definitely be in the limelight of shareholders and investors who are on the lookout to close valuable deals.
The given table gives us a clear picture of the bank statement of a company in the years 2019 to 2023. The total equity of the company has seen a steep rise in curve which gives us a positive outlook of the financial well being of the company with time. As of 2023, it stands at a neutral point in terms of debt to equity which means that the company has never been in debt. The book value has been on the rise which removes the fear of liquidity challenges and helps the company gain the trust of investors and shareholders likewise. The total assets and liabilities of the company show a consequent rise which is a sign that though the company has been able to generate sufficient funds over the years, it still has a good amount of cash owed to its creditors as well. Overall, the company is in a stable position to establish stronger market base in the future and grow it rapidly.
A striking feature observed about the company from the given image depicting the cash flow trends is that, the company had been performing exceptionally in terms of maintaining a positive change in cash flow until 2022. In the years 2023 the company has gone down by high margin which is a matter of concern if the trend keeps on repeating in the upcoming years. The prime reason behind this deviation is the decrease in cash flow from investing activities which has dropped by a heavy margin in the past one year. Trends in cash flow from operating activities present a mixed picture. The company had failed at making money from its core operations in the year 2022 and has revived its previous position by a partial margin in the following years. Overall the company has still a lot of effort to be made in terms of maintaining a net positive change in cash over the years.
The data obtained from the table reflects a mixed variation over the five years in terms of financial stability of the company. The revenue data shows ups and downs with variations that are not very drastic, overall within the same range. It is notable that the operating profit margin of the company has been maintained at an average range with minor ups and downs. Initially the company might have spent more budget on escalating its operational efficiency and has successfully reached the mark in the year 2023 a sis prominent from te high EBITDA value. It is at a sweet spot for shareholders who will be attracted by  the high earnings per share values as of the recent years. Thus the company is at a stable position to channelise its growth in the upward direction with the sheer support of its investors and has future prospects to attain greater targets.
Increase in book value up to 343.52 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023, makes the company represent an optimistic view towards its financal progress. The company has seen minor fluctuations in the year 2020 following which it has again pulled up its pace to increase its value. Total liabilities of the company have increased after 2021 and the company has a lot to payback to its creditors. The total equity of the company being on the increasing slope, shareholders might look forward to future prospects with this company. The debt to equity value of the company needs to be monitored in the upcoming years as it has shown slight increase which means that the company has more of debt finances to repay.
The year 2020 and 2022 has witnessed a drastic decline of the company as the net change in cash flow values had touched the negative number bottom line of -115.37 Cr. Rs. Just at the same instance, the cash flow from investing activities had also touched -419.50 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well. In the past 5 years the company has been trying to maintain a positive value of operating activities cash flow which indicates that the company is making fairly good enough money from its core operations, which will help it to sustain the day to day activities. The company needs to push brakes on investment and try to compensate for the losses incurred due to fairly declining value of cash from investing activities. It is a positive aspect that the net change in cash value has risen up as of 2023 and would be beneficial for the company to maintain growth at the same rate in the upcoming years.
The company data from the table shows a revenue growth curve with slight variations in the first three years. As per the latest revenue record, the company has been successful in achieving the mark of 5143 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The operating profit margin of the company faced slow growth until 2021 post which it has been seen to be slowly declining and has attained a fairly stable point in the year 2023. The year 2023 has witnessed the earnings per share of the company touch the 111.95 Rs. mark which is a lucrative deal for shareholders. While shareholders have found a good deal with this company, it needs to be monitored for future variations in numbers. Overall net profit margin has been actively maintained by the company and shows minor variations. It is imperative that the company balances its revenues and its expenses in order to maintain this consistency in growth.
The table given is a depiction of the balance sheet of a company from 2019 to 2023. It is clear from the given data that the company has been able to sustain itself throughout the past 5 years by making a good asset income. It has expanded its assets and has maintained a higher level of equity. The debt to equity value of the company has slightly increased in the last one year which might have to be monitored. Investors shall have a good attraction towards this company as it has touched a high book value of 603.40 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. Overall the company has been performing moderately well and it would be good if the total liability value is under check. This will ensure that the company does not run into a state of risk in the near future.
It is essential for a company to maintain a net positive cash flow balance throughout in order to ensure that the company relies on well accumulated cash which would in turn enhance the financial flexibility of the company. The table thus shows a downfall of the company in this respect in te years 2020 and 2022. The company has also been able to maintain quite a good margin of profit from financial activities as of 2023 but had faced a severe low in the year 2022 when it touched the -267.23 mark. The company might have deinvested in that particular year or had been in debt, which it professionally compensated in the following years.
The year 2021 had witnessed a tremendous downfall in the net profit margin of the company which had touched -23.71% as against 12.18% of 2019. It is notable that the company revenues had dropped in the year 2022 which throws light on the overall market condition that year. The operational profit margin has shown a consequent fall in the year 2021 and has been rising henceforth at a remarkable rate. Though the company struggled in the year 2021 to maintain a sustainable profit margin, it has slowly backed up again in the year 2022 and this is a point to be highlighted in order to comment on the current status of the company. However the company has a long way to go in order to establish itself in the market scenario and expand its hold. It is also a matter of importance that the company has increased its EPS values in the year 2023 and should be able to enjoy the benefit of investors likewise.
The figures in the given balance sheet of the company show some important facets about the company in the past 5 years. The revenues of the company has slightly dipped in the year 2021 when it touched a total asset value of 13212 Cr. Rs. There might have been challenges in maintaining a high market value or the overall market condition might have gone critical during that time. The company has good amount of non current assets which depicts that the company has invested a lot in long term prospects. However the current asset value is comparatively low. The year 2033 has seen an upsurge in the current asset value which is a sign of stability that the company has been able to sustain its operation activity at a much more productive level. The total equity of the company has seen an increase over the years which is coupled with the increase in book value of the company in comparison to the last year. However the debt to equity value of the company shows very high figures which is not a positive sign for the company's monetary balance in the future.
The data fetched from the table is indicative of the point that the company had declined by a steep margin in the year 2020 due to greater amout of deinvestments. Hand in hand, it had not been able to gather enough cash from financing or via issuing stocks which further added to the negative values. In recent years, the trend in cash flow from operating activities is seen to have been dropping at a higher margin which is a matter of concern if this persists with time. It clearly indicates that the company is not able to sustain enough cash for its daily activities and can lead to the downfall of the company in no time. The overall cash balance as of 2023 stands at 401.48 Cr. Rs. which is a profitable lumpsum amount and shows the financial strength of the company to be stable. However, this data needs to be monitored in the upcoming years too.
The company data highlights a major point in the progress curve of the company. The company had undergone a huge margin of loss in its net profit in the year 2022, where its net profit margin reduced to 0.93%. The company might have been going through a tough time in that year and struggling to keep up with the tremendously increasing expenses. Over the years the revenue growth has increased by a good margin every year and so has the expenses. It is an impressive fact to observe that the year 2023 has an account of lesser expenditure on the part of the company.

It is clear from the given table that the company is doing moderately well in terms of maintaining a steady cash flow from operating activities, but requires significant enhancement in strategies in order to streamline cash flows generated from investing activities and financing sectors. The net change in cash flow has dropped in the year 2023 to a negative value which might indicate the impact of excess losses or the stateof debt the company is in. It is also to be noted that the opening cash flow of the company has been maxmum in the year 2021 whereit touched 203.54 Cr. Rs. post which which it has gradually fallen down.
The statistical reports of the company highlight that the company had massively gone down in the year 2021 in terms of the net profit margin incurred by the company. As revenues gradually dipped in the year 2021 to 878.54 Cr. Rs. , the company has also made a comeback into the market in the following years. The expenses of the company have been balanced at an optimum position and henceforth the overall operating profit margin has also been maintained. The company has been, in recent times, performing better than the initial years. 13.26 Rs. of earnings per share is a good number for shareholders as compared to the previous years. As the dividends per share show increased trends, investors will be highly attracted at this number and should look forward to make the right decision ahead.
The graph of financial figures obtained from the given balance sheet of a company shows some interesting properties. The total revenue generation of the company has been fairly consistent over the years and is depicted from the total asset count of the company which has been constantly on the upward margin. It also has some non current assets which might be an investment for a long term. Total liabilities of the company have also increased in the year which is a warning that the company needs to pay of its creditors in the near future. As we see an increase in the total equity value, it sends a message that the company's worth in the market might have gone up in the recent scenario and the value of its shares and stocks have seen a consequent upgrade. Though the book value of the company has seen fluctuations in the past 5 years currently it stands at 56.96 Cr. Rs. which is a fairly positive figure.
Summing up the observations from the table, we see that the company has been progressing with a more or less same range of opening cash balance all throughout the years. It had tried to get over the uncleared debts and make a moderate improvement in financial activities but has touched down the -358.84 Cr. Rs. bottomline again. Thus the decline is more conspicuous in this case. It has been able to revamp its investment plans a little in the past one year as a result of which the cash flow from investing activities has become a little better in the past year, but it has a lot of efforts to be made in order to neutralise the net negative change in cash and strengthen its financial assets.
The data generated from the table shows the variation in the financial parameters of the company in the past five years. While the company has been able to generate enough revenues over the years, it is a good sign to prove that the company has a good deal of prospective customer base in the market. The operating profit margin of the company has gradually gone down with time which might indicate poor management of workforce and consequently lesser operational efficiency. The company has been able to generate a net profit margin almost in the same range in the past 5 years showing minor variations. Therefore this trend in net profit margin needs to be monitored in order to ensure that the company does not run into a state of loss. As the dividends per share of the company continue to increase at a slow pace, it shall positively have the confidence of investors who are looking forward to close prospective deals with the company. Shareholders shall equally have the support of positive numbers as the earnings per share of the company have increased to to 52.56 Rs. in the year 2023. Progressing at the same pace, the company is expected to show good results in the long run.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has incurred huge profit which is depicted from its net total assets. The total assets of the company has always maintained six digit figures and has been constantly on the rise. The current assets of the company seems to have slightly gone down every year which means that the company has not seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has increased gradually which represents that the company has been able to improve its current worth in the market with time and this is a sign of marked prosperity for the company in the coming years.
The values obtained from the picture displayed depict the five year performance of a company in terms of its financial records. The cash flow values from operating activities reflect that the company has not been performing up to the mark in terms of its core operations which is essential for sustaining the day to day activities of the company. This gradual decline in cash flow is the main reason of decreasing the net change in cash over the years. While the cash flow from investing activities has also been on the negative side, it is evident that the company has involved itself in excess capital expenditures and hence its current expenses need to be cut off. The company has shown exceptional performance in maintaining a positive increase in cash flow obtained from financial activities. The net change in cash overall has been on the negative side consistently which raises concerns on the financial stability and future growth of the company.
The table shows the difference in financial parameters of the company in the years 2022 and 2023. Revenue has seen an increase in the last year and so has the expenses too. However, the company has maintained a good amount of net profit margin irrespective of the escalating expenditure. This is a good catch for investors and shareholders as they will have better benefits from the company in the current market scenario. With increased value of earnings per share touching 167.48 Rs, if the company progresses at the same pace it will soon be able to have an immense net worth in the market which will help the company sustain in the long run.
The data obtained from the table is a comparison of the companies balance statement as depicted in the years 2022 and 2023. The company has comparatively increased its total assets in the year 2023 followed by a slight increase in its non current assets too. The company has not been investing much on long term prospects and has enough capital to finance its short term operations. The total liabilities of the company have been on a steady rise while it's non current liability has also seen the same trend. 2023 has seen an increase in the net equity value of the company which is a remark of enhanced financial stability. The company has also been able to maintain a consistent rate of stocks which makes it a central point of attraction from shareholders as they do not expect much fluctuations in the companies net market worth.
From the table given above we see a comparison in the cash flow parameters of a company over the year 2022 and 2023. The opening cash balance of the company has gone down in the year 2023 followed by an increase in cash flow from operating activities. This is a proof that the company has been able to make good profit from its core functions which is essential for maintaining an equilibrium in day-to-day financial activities. The investing activities have not generated much cash in both years which lays emphasis on the fact that the company might have made too many divestments or significant capital expenditures. The negative values of cash flow through financial activities also mean that the company might be under debt for a short period of time. Overall the net change in cash balance needs to be maintained at a positive number so that the company can turn out to be profitable in the market in the long run.
The data shown in the table is clearly indicative of the fact that the company has undergone varying transitions throughout the period of the past 5 years. The year 2019 to 2021 had witnessed a marked decline in the overall operational efficiency of the company and consequently its net profit. The company had been running on sheer loss over the period of 3 years from 2019 to 2021. In the year 2022 the company has witnessed a comparative increase in its profit margin which is a good sign of a strong comeback. The past 2 years has seen the company in a much better position which is imperative for attracting investors and shareholders. The expenses have been on the rise but seem to be properly balanced with the increasing revenues in the past 2 years. Hence, the company is regaining its stability gradually and is at a much better position financially then it was 5 years back.
A significant contribution of the company towards its shareholders and overall growth and development in the years 2019 to 2023 is clearly depicted from the balance sheet given in the picture. The company has faced a steep increase over the years and this has resulted in an improved financial stability of the company. Though the asset count has slightly decreased in the year 2020, it did not harm the overall upward curve of the company's growth. The company has a huge amount of non current assets withstanding in its name which point to the fact that it has made huge investment in long term prospects which are less liquid in nature. The common stock has drastically increased in value in the year 2021 and is a boon for all its shareholders. Thus the company is at a position of investor expectations that it shall be much more profitable in the future.
The table given depicts the highs and lows in the cash flow values of a company over a span of five years. The cash flow from operating activities had gone down drastically for 2 years post which it has been able to reach a steady margin of 1428 Cr. Rs. It is interesting to know that the cash flow from investing activities have always been on the decline with the deepest point at -446.23 Cr. Rs. As of 2023, the company has made a strictly declining cash flow from financial activities which stands at -1332 Cr. Rs. The company might have been suffering from debt repayment or stock buybacks. Consequently the net cash inflow for the company has also seen a slightly positive value in 2023 as opposed to the continuous negative numbers in the previous 2 years which gives some confidence on the company's short term investments.
The statistical reports of the company from the year 2019 to the year 2023 depict trends in financial parameters of the company that need to be addressed. The company had made a whooping profit margin in the year 2021. Following the year, the company has seen a gradual decline in its net profit margin which is showing a striking fluctuation. The operating profit margin has also gone down demonstrating sheer decline in operation and efficiency. Though the company is continuing to make handsome revenues, it has not been able to acquire the most of it and convert them into a lucrative handsome amount. Decrease in net worth of the company in the market is evident from the decrease in its earnings per share value which is not a good news for shareholders at this stage. Overall the company needs to buck up and bring about amendments in its strategies so as to turn the net revenue generated into a profitable lumpsum amount.
The data obtained from the given balance sheet table of a company shows a number of aspects about the financial ups and downs faced by the company from the year 2019 to 2023. Book value of the company has constantly been on the rise touching the mark of 606.56 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. This is a sign that there hasn't been much non cash charge recorded from the companies side. This has in turn led to an increase in revenues and significant increase in the asset values. The company has also been successful in maintaining a high equity value over the years which is a positive sign that the company's operating performance has been at par. This is a testament of the fact that the company has not incurred excess debt to finance. The debt to equity of the company has slightly increased in the past 1 year which means that the company has a long way to go in order to make significant neutralisation of monetary assets towards its creditors.
The numbers obtained from the given table throw light on the varying trends in cash flow values of a company over the past 5 years between 2019 to 2023. It has been a commendable job on the part of the company to maintain a positive cash flow from operating activities throughout the past five years. It highlights the high amount of cash generated from the company's core operations. The cash flow from investing activities has touched the negative mark and is on the decline with every passing year. It is essential that the company reconsiders its investment strategies or pushes itself to curtail excess investment for a particular time. The amount of cash generated by the company from stocks and other resources had slightly gone down in the year 2020 and 2021 when it touched minus -137.46 Cr. Rs. However the current value as of 2023 stands at 741.32 Cr. Rs. which is a good number. Therefore we can conclude from the observations that though the company has seen major setback in the year 2020 and 2022, the company has tried to recover from the state of loss in the year 2023 supported by a net change in cash flow of 154.10 Cr. Rs.
The table given shows the overall financial growth of the company in the past 4 years from 2020 to 2023. The company had been progressively increasing its revenues until 2022 but has seen a slight decline in revenues in the last year. Expenses have demonstrated similar trends over the years. It is to be noted that the EBITDA values have gone down in recent times, hereby hinting at a decreased rate of operational efficiency. Since the operating profit margin of the company is gradually on the decline, it is a point of concern for the company in order to sustain itself in the long run. The download slope in the net profit margin made over the years needs to be compensated at the earliest so that the company can establish a strong foothold in the market. The earnings of the company has reached 47.43 Rs. in the last year which might effect share holders, ensuring a lesser profit.
It is evident from the given table of the company's balance sheet that the company has made significant increase in asset generation over the years 2020 to 2023. As a result the company has been able to maintain a stable state throughout the years. The increase in current assets of the company throw light on the point that the company has a lot of short term withstanding cash. Hand in hand the liabilities have gone up too and touched 818.81 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. It is significant to note that the non-current liabilities have currently declined a little which might indicate that the company has mitigated some of its long term obligations that it had towards other companies. The total equity range is also on the rise which is an indication that the company is not depending a lot on external sources and has effective business strategies. Overall the company is in a pretty positive financial position and may look forward to increasing market revenue and asset levels.
It is significant to note from the given table that the company has been performing with minor ups and downs in the past 4 years between 2020 to 2023. While the opening cash balance has risen as of 2022 to 492.46 Cr. Rs., the cash flow from operating activities that has been generated over the years also shows a positive trend. The company has been making better investment deals as of 2023 which is evident from the cash flow from investing activities as it denotes a positive number. Carefully observing, in the previous years the company might have spent excess on investments which could not finally bear any fruit. The cash flow from financial activities also signals cash obtained from stock purchases and other external buys. The net change in cash value over the last four years show drastic fluctuation with negative values in the year 2020 and 2022 which might indicate that the company had been going through a rough time. As per the latest trend observed, net change in cash in 2023 stands at 1590 Cr. Rs. which is a heavily good margin.
The financial reports of the company obtained from the table show a tremendously upward revenue growth of the company in the past 5 years which is a sign of increased customer satisfaction and indicates that the products of the company do have a prospective market base. Though expenses have increased hand in hand, the overall operating profit margin has slightly gone down but has been maintained at the same range almost throughout. A notable feature regarding the company data shown is that the net profit margin of the company has been steeply declining over the years which is a marked concern for long term prospects of the company. The earnings per share value of the company has also reduced to 3.87 Rs. in the year 2023 which indicates that the net worth of the company has gone down in the current market scenario. Thus it is necessary that the company needs to improvise on its management and efficiency in order to make profit out of its increaseing revenues.
The tremendous upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of sheer prosperity for the company in the years 2019-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name which can be converted to cash without a significant loss in value. The equity of the company has touched the 22489 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown a straight dip in the year 2020 touching 55.87 Cr. Rs. post which the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value to 148.81 Cr. Rs. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The picture gives us the financial values of cash flow data for a particular company during the year 2019 to 2023. The opening cash balance of the company as maintained every year is at a fairly average rate. The company is making good revenue and is able to maintain enough cash flow from its daily operations which is essential for sustaining the day-to-day activities. It is to be noted that the cash flow from financial activities have seen a steep rise from 2019 onwards and has increased by a drastic margin in the past year when it touched 13,049 Cr. Rs. The positive values signal cash raised from financing sources which might include from issued stocks or from borrowing. Hence the company is at a highly profitable position. Financial standards of the company can be further upgraded if the company pushes brakes on investments that do not bear an equilibrium return. This will prevent the cash flow from investing activities touch the negative mark. On an average the company has been able to maintain a net positive change in cash value over the past 5 years with a dip in the year 2022, following a state from which the company has revived itself.
The statistics report of the company as is evident from the given table reflects the highs and lows faced by the company in terms of its financial aspects in the past 5 years. The revenue of the company seems to have gone down overall as compared to the year 2019. Expenses have demonstrated a similar trend followed by variation in operational efficiency too. Over the years the company has been making a net profit margin more or less in the same range but has witnessed a loss every consecutive year. In general we cannot conclude anything definite about the future prospects of the company currently as the fluctations seem to be constant. Investors should observe these highs and lows carefully in the future before entering into a decision with this company.
From the data fetched from the given balance sheet of a company, it is easy to point out that the total assets of the company has seen an increase over the years with a maximum increase gap from the year 2022 to 2023. The current assets of the company has also increased in the same rate thus indicating that the company has enough financial stability to make a smooth operation of all its daily activities. The total liabilities of the company has seen a sudden spike in the year 2023 when it touched 5461 Cr. Rs. This figure needs to be compensated in order to ensure that the company is able to sustain itself financially and does not resort to a state of risk. The total equity of the company has shown an upward growth, needless to say that the company has been performing appreciably well and is in the center of attraction of investors and shareholders.
The year 2022 has witnessed a drastic decline of the company as the net change in cash flow values had touched the negative number bottom line of -191.87 Cr. Rs. Just at the same instance, the cash flow from investing activities had also touched -573.01 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well. In the past 5 years the company has been trying to maintain a positive value of operating activities cash flow which indicates that the company is making fairly good enough money from its core operations, which will help it to sustain the day to day activities. The company needs to push brakes on investment and try to compensate for the losses incurred due to fairly declining value of cash from investing activities. It is a positive aspect that the net change in cash value has risen up as of 2023 and would be beneficial for the company to maintain growth at the same rate in the upcoming years.
The year 2021 had witnessed a tremendous downfall in the net profit margin of the company which had touched 2.21% as against 10.52% of 2020. It is notable that the company revenues had dropped in the year 2021 which throws light on the overall market condition that year. The operational profit margin has shown a consequent rise but at a very slow pace. Though the company struggled in the year 2021-2022 to maintain a sustainable profit margin, it has slowly backed up again in the year 2023 and this is a point to be highlighted in order to comment on the current status of the company. However the company has a long way to go in order to establish itself in the market scenario and expand its hold. It is a matter of concern that the earnings per share of the company have drastically gone down in the past 3 years which is not a good news for shareholders and investors.
The trends in the total assets of the company as seen from the given balance sheet depicts an overall steady upward growth of revenue except for a minor fall in year 2020 when the total assets of the company touched 39888 Cr. Rs. The company has been able to sustain itself with a huge amount of non current assets as well as maintain an optimum amount of current assets for its everyday operations. Liabilities of the company has seen a net decline over the years which is a sign that the company has been able to cut down the overhead expenses that it owed to its creditors. However the non current liabilities are still increasing in number which typically include long-term debt. This can also be seen as a way for the company to finance long-term investments but also increases the financial risk of the company. Common stock values of the company has almost doubled in the past 2 years which is definitely a plus point for its shareholders. The company has also been able to maintain a lower value of debt to equity over the past 2 years. The company needs to keep a check on the drastically decreasing book value which has touched 22.15 Cr. Rs. as of 2023 and indicates that the company has been going down in time in terms of its financial strength.
It is clear from the given table that the company is doing moderately well in terms of maintaining a steady cash flow from operating activities, but requires significant enhancement in strategies in order to streamline cash flows generated from investing activities. The net change in cash flow has dropped in the year 2022 to a negative value which might indicate the impact of excess losses or the state of debt the company is in. It is also to be noted that the opening cash flow of the company has been maxmum in the year 2022 where it touched 648.04 Cr. Rs. post which which it has gradually fallen down. Overall, teh company needs to be monitored slightly so as to enhance the deinvestment values and escalate the net change in cash.
The company's financial reports over the period of 2019 to 2023 are displayed in the above table. It is worthy to note the decline of the company in the year 2020 to 2021 when it was at a stage of loss. The net profit margin of the company had stooped as low as a negative 6.74% which consequently increased by a little in the year 2021 and reached -1.51%. The revenue generation of the company had also witnessed a major decline in the same years which hint that the company struggled to find enough market for its products at that stage. In general following the years from 2021 onwords, there has been an exponential rise in the revenue made by the company and correspondingly there has been a share value increase along with its operational efficiency. While the company is recovering from the state of loss, shareholders can look forward to entering into prospects with this company once again considering the point that the company has regained its financial stability in recent years.
The statistics obtained from the given balance sheet table of a company is a representative of the fact that the company has seen ups and downs in its revenue growth over the years. Total asset of the company had consequently decreased in the year 2020 when it touched 30565 Cr. Rs., post which the company has slightly been able to make the curve grow. The current assets of the company is in huge number which shows that the financial everyday needs of the company should not be compromised with. Liability also show ups and downs. As of 2023, the total liability has touched 25,000 Cr. Rs. and needs to be reduced by a far greater margin. The company has also been involved in non current liabilities which might be a strategy for maintaining long-term investments. The total equity of the company had strangely gone down in the year 2021 when it touched down to 4248 Cr. Rs. , which indicates that the company had seen a decline in its financial status. However in the following years it has been able to regain its original state and make a mark in the rapidly developing market with a higher book value and a good position. It can look into its liability mitigation plans in order to stay on the safer side.
The opening balance of the company shows drastic variation over the years which seems like the company has been struggling to maintain an average rate of revenues. Revenues had significantly fallen down in 2021 and the operating activities of the company failed to generate enough cashflow. The companies deinvestments have impacted the net balance and as a result the company has witnessed a major dip in net cash balance. This might pose a threat to the stability of the company in the long run. The company has been running into debt in the past 2 years and might have a lot of withstanding expenditure. Though the company is struggling to improve its performance and has reached slight positive value of cash balance in the year 2023 touching 1.28 Cr. Rs., it still has a long way to go in order to establish a strong financial status.
From the table given, it is imperative to note that the financial reports of the company in the past five years from 2019 to 2023 has been one with tremendous number of fluctuations. The company reports demonstrate mixed numbers. As we observe that the dividends per share value of the company has increased with time from 2009 where it was 2.00 Rs. to 7.50 Rs. in the year 2020, this is a bonus point for investors looking out for prospects with this company. The company has been able to make good enough revenue growth in the past 5 years, however the operating efficiency and net profit margin over the years has not followed the same trend. The year 2021 has witnessed the maximum weight of net profit margin made by the company post which the company seems to have been on the decline in terms of profit margin. Consequently the operational profit margin of the company has also been compromised with. It is necessary to bring about change in strategic plans of the company in order to change the direction of the net profit margin curve which has stooped low since 2022. Shareholders should look forward to buying shares only after a little period of monitoring the earnings per share of the company with mark optimism.
It is evident from the given balance sheet of the company that over the years between 2019 to 2023 the company has witnessed a steady growth in its total assets. This might reflect that the company has spread across the country or expanded its sectors over a wider market base. Total equity of the company had gone at its lowest in the past year which is definitely a positive sign and shows that the company has been able to repay back its creditors at a considerable progressive rate. Assets of the company have increased over the years and is essential in order to maintain the smooth functioning of the company. The debt to equity value of the company as seen from the table has increased over the years and will not attract shareholders in the future. Another prominent feature is the massive rise in book value every year which indicates that the company has enough financial strength and shall not resort into a state of depth or financial risk.
The year 2019 had witnessed a poor inflow from investing activities of the company as is shown from the data given. This highlights the fact that the organisation has not been operating profitably and is short of cash to repay its creditors. With the coming years, there have been transitions at the operational level and the company has been able to make better gains but it is still making deinvestments. The cash flow from investing activities need to be looked into as this is seen to affect the net cash flow of the company. Also, the company seems to be in a state of debt or is involved in stock buybacks as a result of which its cash flow from financing activities is going down with time. A prominent aspect to be noted here is the vast difference in the net change in cash balance as compared to the year 2019 which gives some hope for a positive transition of the company in the recent years.
The data given in the table show a mark increase in revenues over the years for the company with the maximum revenue reaching in the year 2023 lately which is 31,431 Cr. Rs. Expenses have been in full swing and appear to go hand and hand with the revenue. Overall, the company's net profit has been maintain in the same range but show mixed numbers. In 2022 the profit margin faced a slight dip with a minor rise again as of 2023. The earnings for share of the company had peaked in the year 2021 when it reached 14.51 Rs. and as of 2023, the value is maintained at an optimum level. Shareholders can look forward to prospects with this company with marked consideration.
The statistical reports obtained from the table is a testament of the asset management of the company in the past 5 years. The table shows highly positive values in increasing revenue, with the current assets of the company witnessing a steady growth. However it is indispensable to note that the total liabilities of the company has drastically increased with time and the company owes a huge amount of current liabilities. As of 2020 the company had a few non-current liabilities that throw light on the fact that it had not been much involved in long-term plans. Total equity of the company has been rising steadily until 2022 but has seen a gradual decline in the last year which might eye to challenges that the company might be facing in establishing or expanding its market across a vital customer base. The debt to equity values have decreased in comparison to the previous year but the company has still a long way to go in order to reduce the total debt to equity value and make a stronger hold in the market.
It is evident from the table that the investing activities of the company have witnessed a massive decline in numbers over the years which is a sign that the investments of the company have generated lesser returns than expected, thus leading the company to a state of loss. The company has seen the same trend in dealing with its financial activities too, with slight improvement in the year 2022 where it reached a positive figure of 387.97 Cr. Rs. The overall performance of the company has been at par with the success curve as the company has been maintaining a positive net cash flow after the year 2021, the highest value reaching 461.87 Cr. Rs. It is indicative that the company needs to  focus on inflow of cash from a its long-term investments to balance the amount of cash equivalents leaving and entering a company.
The table above gives us a glimpse of the company's losses in the year 2019 to 2023. The net profit margin of the company rose gradually from the year 2019 to 2021 when it reach 21.56%, post which it witnessed another dip in values until 2023. Thus the company had reached a peak point of its operation as well as net profit margin in the year 2021 which might hint at possible reorganization or change in business development plans. The revenue curve of the company shows variations until 2022 post which there has been a double increase in revenue in the year 2023 when it touched 14,349 Cr. Rs. benchmark. Expenses have been increasing hand in hand with increase in revenues and the company has not been able to cope with this changing phenomenon. Shareholders can still have prospects with the company as the latest earnings per share value shows an absolute rise touching the point 23.42 Rs. as well as high dividend rate as compared to the previous years. It might also be suitable for investors to invest in this company and hold future prospects considering the company flourishes at the same pace.
The given data fetched from the companies balance sheet report gives and insight into the financial status of the company and its asset management strategies over the years 2019 to 2023. The current assets of the company has also been on the rise and there is no fear of a sudden loss or shortage of finances for the daily run of the company. However it is considerable to know that the total liabilities have increased over the years with lesser rate of non current liabilities. It does not have very long term Investment plans in mind but needs to work on mitigating the current liabilities and bringing them down to a stand still. The appreciative part is the net rise in the total equity values which stands at 7931 Cr. Rs. as of 20203. The data is thus indicative of a positive upward growth of the company and shows prospects of gaining more investing funds.
The data fetched from the table is indicative of the point that the company had declined by a steep margin in the year 2021 due to greater amout of deinvestments. Hand in hand, it had not been able to gather enough cash from financing or via issuing stocks which further added to the negative values. In recent years, the trend in cash flow from operating activities is seen to have a positive growth. It clearly indicates that the company is able to sustain enough cash for its daily activities and can lead to the betterment of the company. The overall cash balance as of 2023 stands at 30.61 Cr. Rs. which is a profitable lumpsum comparitive to the previous years and shows the financial strength of the company to have escalated. However, this data needs to be monitored in the upcoming years too.
From the given table it is imperative to note that the company had faced a severe downfall in the year 2020 when its revenues reached 397.36 Cr. Rs. following which it touched even below the 2020 mark. However in the year 2022 the company made significant betterment in terms of revenue generation and touched the 727.25 Cr. Rs. benchmark. As that of 2023 the company has been prosperously showing an upward drift in values in terms of expenses. There is a question on the operational efficiency of the company as is evident from the negative EBITDA values. It is to be noted that in the last year the company has seen a massive downfall and its earnings per share has also reached -4.74 Rs. which is a mark of sheer concern for its shareholders. There might be an urgent need of reorganisation or reconstruction of strategies in order to compensate for the losses incurred by the company in the past year.
The given balance sheet table of the company is a representative of the current financial status of the company and gives hints about its future prospects. Current assets have seen an upsurge over time in 2023 when it touched 946 Cr. Rs. The company might have changed its strategies or has been involved in operational plans which led to a sudden increase in its current asset margin. With the current liability on the rise, the company holds enough money to convert into cash in a short term, while the total equity values continue to increase. The debt to equity value has significantly gone down in the year 2023 which is a positive aspect deciphered from the table. Hence the company shall attract investors as per the latest trends and can look forward to a brighter future.
The opening cash balance of the company does not hold up a very profitable picture of the company as the revenue generation seems to have gone low in the years 2020 and 2022. This drastic decline has somehow been balanced by the cash flow from other sources, reuslting in an overall net positive balance of the company. A matter of concern is the declining values of cash flow from operating activities which is indicative of the fact that the company has not been maintaining day to day profits in business or the net capital of the company is on the decline. This is crucial to sustain the company and its resources. In the year 2023, there has been drastic deinvestments and the company needs to adhere to the fact that it should carefully target potential opportunities in its current business. The fact that the company is doing better than the year 2021 in term sof maintaining an average range of net profit is a ray of hope that the company might upscale this margin in the long run.
The numbers obtained from the table show mixed trends and throw light on the fluctuating net profit margins of the company over the past 5 years. The company has been influential in generating high amount of revenues across the years, which clearly shows the demand of the products or services that the company has to offer. The company also has a wide customer base which has enabled it to touch a revenue of 24,609 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. It is also making optimum investment on its labour and productivity as is prominent from the growing expenses over the years. There are areas where the company still needs to work on to reach a stable point in its net profit margin graph. The fluctuation in numbers will reduce the trust of investors on the company which might hamper the sustainable growth of the company in the long run. Earnings per share has touched 17.39 rs. in the year 2023, the highest in the past 5 years. Thus the company is steadily progressing towards increasing its market worth and gaining the confidence of its shareholders.
The balance statement of the company as seen in the first five years period indicates an amazing performance in the last one year. The debt to equity has seen a corresponding decrease. It is notable that the total equity of the company has risen and reflects the financial progress of the company. It has also been involved in long term investment plans and debt mitigation strategies as is evident from the slight decrease in total liability in the past year. Overall the company looks to be at a fair position and has been able to maintain its revenue generation process by a good margin.
The recent trends in the net cash balance of the company signify passive numbers as the negative values indicate a state of loss. The company might be in a current state of debt and has touched the cash flow from financial activity mark of -1692 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company had been facing a tough time in the year 2020 where it suffered a loss in cash of -2817 Cr. Rs. from its investing activities, following which it seems to have made some reformations and improved the situation. It still has a long way to go in making a positive figure and add to the net balance of the company. Th ecompany is currently in a state of debt or is undergoing share buybacks for long term investments which has resulted in the rapid decline of the cash flow rates lately.
The year 2021 has witnessed a slight downfall in the progress of the company over the past five years from 2019-2023 post which it has steadily tried to gain back its upward growth in the booming market. As of 2023, the revenues of the company reached 2021 Cr. Rs. , the highest in the last five years. Thus currently the company is at a stable position and is able to sell its products across a good number of customers. Hand in hand goes the operational efficiency of the company which is a good sign of sustainability. The company had been struggling hard in the year 2021 in maintaining a good level of net profit margin but has shown impeccable growth in 2021-2022 when it drifted from 4.67% to 13.43%. Consequently, shareholders can have better profits with the company at the current stage as the earnings per share of the company have also risen in the year 2023 to 10.15 Rs. In general, the company is at a pretty steady state and should be considered for making beneficial investments.
From the given table, transitions in asset management trends that the company has witnessed in the last five years is quite prominent. The company has a lot to repay to its creditors. The count of liabilities need to be curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been falling in the same range which might be a part of the companies future growth. The total equity of the company has a massive rise in the last one year touching 2489 Cr. Rs. , and is a positive sign for all its shareholders. The debt to equity values of the company has seen a slight increase in the past 2 years which might raise concerns on the fact that the company owes a lot of money to other businesses. This number needs to be maintained in the long run and the company needs to reform its business strategies in order to make the numbers count.
The trend in cash flow from investing activities as per the table denotes the amount of deinvestments that the company has gone through. It probably has  made surplus expenditures in purchases of physical assets or invested in sales and securities. However, it has been exceptionally able to maintain a steady upward curve in terms of cashflow from its operating activities which has been a boon to a highly positive net balance. This puts the company at a very stable position to continue in the long run and escalate its business prospects. As of 2023, the net increased balance stands at 647.81 Cr. Rs. , which has been the highest recorded in the past five years and is a sign of marked financial strength for the company.
The data from the table shows a prominent loss incurred by the company in the past five years and is indicative of the slow progress and decline of the company. Unfortunately the company has not been performing efficiently in terms of net profits as the values are still at negative standpoints. Though the revenues have increased over the years, the higher rate of increasing expenses have dominated the income of the company. This also indicates that the company has been spending too much on overhead expenses or fixed resource costs. As a result, the operational profit margin is on the negative isde too. thoughthe company has performed better than teh year 2019 in the recent times, it still has a long way to go in order to make a stable hold and sustain itself for long. This is absolutely not the right choice for shareholders and investors at this stage.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has increased drastically in the year 2023 touching 11189 Cr. Rs. The current assets of the company seems to have slightly gone down in 2020-2021 which means that the company has not seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has witnessed steep downfall in 2022 when it reached the  bottomline of 92.78 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had been going through a rough time in handling its liabilities and had degraded its financial situation.
The company has initially started with a declining revenue count and the opening balance stood at -13.66 Cr. Rs. as of 2019. With the cooperation of shareholders and strategic stock management  plans, it had been able to generate enough cash to sustain itself and generate a net profit. Over the years, there has been a fluctuation in the core operational activities of the company which has caused the cash flow form operating activities to vary rapidly. However the company has been performing better at asset management in the year 2022-2023 and this is a sign of prosperity that will help in compensation of its losses.
The company statistics demonstrated in the given table show a marked improvement in the amount of revenues generated in the years 2021-2022. Initially the company was capable of making 687.44 Cr. Rs.  in the year 2019  which slowly declined over the years and fell down to 654.65 Cr. Rs. in the year 2021. The company seems to be struggling in terms of maintaining an optimum level of efficiency at work too. However from 2022 onwards, it has been able to upgrade itself and increase its revenues by a good margin. Currently its expenses have increased too, which indicates the company is spending good amount of money on its labour and resources. It still needs to make a lot of progress in maintaining a balance between its revenues and expenses as the profit margin shows strict variations. The earnings per shares of the company have gone down in the past one year which eyes at the net worth of the company in the current market. Thus, the company still needs to make some progress in order to be an eye-catcher for shareholders and market investors and fetch fruitful returns.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain a slow but gradual increase in its total equity over the years. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. Current assets of the company has also touched the mark of 4954 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company had enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. However it has slightly gone down in the year 2023. Assets have always been on the increase except in 2023 when it witnessed a sudden decline in total assets. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation in the year 2023 or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has increased throughout, the book value has seen rapid decline which is also a negative sign for the company in the long run. Investors might not look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
The data generated in the table depict mixed numbers. The company has been consecutively witnessing a low in its net cash balance which raises a question of instability on the operations of the company. The company has dropped in terms of cash flow from its investing activities by a huge margin and needs to be monitored. It might have made huge investments for long term health benefits of the company as a result of which it has bene witnessing lows in cash flows. Overall, the company is not at a very stable position to look forward to great prospects until it makes marked progress in its declining domains.
The data shown in the table indicates the financial status of the company in the past 5 years and presents an overall positive picture. The company is steadily growing in terms of net profit margin which is imperative for sustaining the company in the long run. Overall the profits have risen from 4.27% in 2019 to 6.91% in 2023. While the year 2021 has seen a minor dip in revenues, the organisation has managed to pull up its socks and further set the revenue curve on the rise. As of 2023, it stands at 6,930 Cr. Rs., the highest in the past 5 years, which is indeed an optimistic count for shareholders and investors likewise. It is notable that there is a marked balance maintainted between the revenue and expenses values, which has enabled the company to generate enough profit over the years. The operational functions of the company also seem to be in full swing with a minor decline in the year 2021 as is evident from the EBITDA value but has reached greater heights in recent years. Thus, shareholders will definitely be sttracted to the rising prosperity of the company and hold optimistic hopes.
The gradual upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of fair financial stability for the company in the years 2019-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name which can be converted to cash without a significant loss in value. The equity of the company has touched the 2589 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown a straight dip in the year 2019 touching 95.58 Cr. Rs. post which the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value to 287.08 Cr. Rs. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The table demonstrates the cash flow trends of a company in the past five years which highlights its performance in terms of the net cash earned. The net balance of the company which represents the financial stability and future sustainability of the company shows amazingly positive numbers since the year 2020. The value had reached negative figures in 2019 and was impacted by the huge decline of cash flow from its financial activities. The company might have been in debt or is not making enough profit from its stock exchanges which is taking the company finances down the curve. While the income from its operational sectors is going fine in the upward direction, shareholders can confidently hold trust on the future stability of the company.
The revenue generated by the company, as is evident from the given table, is the maximum in the past one year. Thus, the company is making good money and is flourishing in terms of operational efficiency too. The company had been performing low in the year 2021 but has been able to get back to its original phase phase as is indicated by increasing values of profit margin. The profit margin as of 2023 stands at 7.38% which is a good number in comparison to the previous years. Shareholders can rely on the company too as the earnings per share have touched 28.96 Rs. in the year 2023 and the company looks profitable enough in the currentmarlet scenario.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2019-2023. The burning rate of total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. However it is to be noted that the book value of the company has gone done by a slight margin in the year 2022. This needs to be analysed as it might hint to a fluctuating market scenario or likewise. Stock rates of this company have been maintained at a consistent level which is a parameter that might attract shareholders in the long run.
The data fetched from the table highlights that the company did not have much of financial stability to start with in the year 2019, it made an attempt with an initial revenue of -361.35 Cr. Rs. However with the support of stock management and rebuying of stocks, the company made its mark in the market by a handsome net change in cash balance at the end of the year. Following this, the opening cash balance of the company has been at a fairly good starting point. The net balance has dropped to negative values in the year 2020-2021 due to high rate of deinvestments that the ocmpany had faced. Post this, it has tried ot pull up its socks and proceed towards more strategic invetsments which is a sign of improvement of the company. As of the last two years, the financial strength of the company has been commendable with it reaching the peak net cash flow balance 976.59 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. Following this trend, the company has positive prospects of a stable future.
The overall trend of the company throws light on two aspects mainly - the company has been maintaining fairly good range of revenue though the progress is slow and the profit margin over the years has significantly gone down demonstrating poor planning or operational strategies. It is a felt need for the company to balance the rate of increasing expenses or cut down its expenditures so as to stabilize the growth of the company and makes the numbers count. Over the years the company has also dropped in terms of worth as is noted from the decreasing values of earnings per share which varies from 47.73 Rs. in the year 2020 to 18.58 Rs. in the year 2023. It is imperative for investors to keep an account of the dividends per share made by the company over the years as the values have gone down from 8.00 Rs. to 4.00 Rs since 2021.
The data generated from the table throw light on the trend in balance statement parameters of a particular company. The company has slightly increased its debt to equity value in the year 2023 which proves greater instability of the company in handling assets. It has been trying to increase its production and efficiency over the years. The total asset values have seen a gradual increase over the years. Hand in hand, total liabilities have also increased with time except for 2021 when it saw a minor dip. There is a felt need to mitigate these values. Failing to compensate for these might let the company into a state of loss. Stock prices of the company have been in an overall consistent range as a result of which the company has been making profit and has been able to win the trust of shareholders but more work is needed to maintain its book value too.
The cash flow table is a measure of the overall financial performance of the company in the past 5 years. Except for the year 2020, where the company had seen a drastic decline in its net cash flow change, the company has shown commendable figures of net cash balance. This proves that the company has been exceptionally efficient in maintaining a positive outlook for all its investors. The net income from financial activities has also seen a gradual enhancement over the years which means that the company has been investing efforts on changing its stock market management strategies. Therefore, the company stands at a much profitable position in the market with good amount of future hopes.
The company statistics show prosperous numbers in terms of revenue generataion in the past 2 years. Revenue dipped in the year 2021 by a slight margin but has stabilized itself in the coming years. The net profit margin of the company in the past 5 years show dynamic statistics. The year 2021 has seen a massive downfall of the company when the profit margin had gone as low as 4.13% as compared to 67.89% in the previous year. Consequently it faced a huge setback in terms of operational profit too. Earnings per share had gone down to 4.13% and the company seems to have gone through a rough time. However it has made a strong comeback in recent years and is still in the phase of reviving its previous statistics. As earnings per share touch 90.95 Rs. in the last year, investors can have good opportunities with this company in the near future.
The balance statement of the company as seen in the first five years period indicates an amazing performance across the years. The debt to equity has seen a corresponding decrease. It is notable that the total equity of the company has risen and reflects the financial progress of the company. It has also been involved in long term investment plans and debt mitigation strategies as is evident from the overall balanced structure of liabilities over the years. Overall the company looks to be at a fair position and has been able to maintain its revenue generation process by a good margin.
The opening cash balance of the company shows varying trends. It is seen that the company revenues have gone down gradually over the years which might point to a reduction in market demand for its customer base. This needs to be analysed in order to ensure better rates of net cash balance that the company holds for its sustainable growth at the end of the year. As per the current trends, the company has been prey to a number of excess expenditures and has not been performing impressively in managing its financial assets. This has resulted in a straight decrease in its overall balance in the year 2023 which is a mark of concern.
With every incoming year, the expenses continue to increase and has touched 2149 Cr. Rs. as of 2022. A remarkable fact is that the company has proved to be efficient enough to balance its increasing expenses and steadily improve its net profit margin. While the company is flourishing in terms of operational efficiency, shareholders and invetsors will definitely be attracted to its increased market value. Earnings per share have reached 77.26 Rs. in the year 2023 which is a sign of growth and better future prospects. Overall, the financial position of the company in the market is commendable at this stage and can be relied on.
From the given table it is a matter to concentrate on the fact that the company has been making significant progress over the years in terms of total revenue generation, which is evident from the figures of its total assets. The year 2022 has seen an increase in the total asset value by a huge margin when it touched 2831 Cr. Rs. The non current liabilities is a depiction that the company had increased its long term investments in the year 2020 and thus it relies on external resources for funding. Liabilities of the company has increased in the past two years which needs to be monitored and cut down at the earliest. The company also has a good amount of current liability in its name which has increased over the years. This might include short term fulfillment of its obligations which if not taken seriously can put the company at a financial risk. The debt to equity of the company seems to have increased a little bit with time which is a negative sign as the company is dependent on its creditors. Thus the company has been maintaining a fair asset margin, but it would be good for it to look into the liability value figures to reach a better position in the market.
A lot of progress is needed from the part of the company in order to strategically plan its investments at the right time and on the right assets so that the declining rate of cash flow from investments can be compensated. The operating activities that the company has indulged in have given positive returns with slight changes over the years. This slight drop in cashflow might be a result of low inventory turnover rates or a decrease in the net outstanding sales. This is an important parameter as it overall balances the losses incurred as a result of deinvestments and excess expenditure on stocks. As of 2022, the company has been able to touch the mark of 29.33 Cr. Rs. net balance which is a positive figure but fairly lower in comparison to 2018-2019.
The data from the table signifies a decline in the operating profit margin of the company in the last five years which is indicative of a dip in the functional aspects of the organisation. It is to be noted that the net profit margin has also decreased over the years reaching a maximum of 8.18% in 2020 to 5.45% in 2023. While the earnings per share has been on an average range, investors can have faith on its numbers. The company has been performing well in terms of revenue generation but as the expenses continue to increase, it still has a long way to go in terms of maintaining an optimum amount of profit margin.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company till the year 2023, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself over the years. There is a greater scope of potential growth as there is no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company has shown fluctuating numbers which represents that the company is more or lessin the same range to finance its operations. However the obligations of the company in recent years has increased and the liabilities have touched the 2390 Cr. Rs. mark. A positive outlook of the company is presented by the steady growth of equity over the years which might have resulted from selling shares of stocks. Thus the company has grown significantly over the period and is in a stable position in the rapidly developing market.
Over the years, the company has witnessed a negative figure of cashflow from investing activities which indicates that the company has paid out capital, such as retiring or paying off long-term debt or making a dividend payment to shareholders. This rate of decline is seen to be consistent in the recent years. The financial activities have also generated a negative cash flow but is declining at a lesser rate. Since the company is able to maintain its core activities at a steady pace, the operating activities are well managed. However as a matter of fact, the cash flow generated form this domain has not been successful in balancing the net loss faced by the company form other activities. As a result, the net cash flow of the company has touched -114.94 Cr. Rs. as of 2023, the lowest in the past 5 years.
Shareholders and investors will definitely not be attracted to this company anymore based on the comparitive downfall in the values of earnings per share and the dividend numbers in the past five years. the graph shows a massive decline as the earnings per share decreased from 51.38 Rs. in the year 2022 to 9.68 Rs. in the year 2023. Thus the profitability and worth of the company has gone down by an extensive margin and needs to be highly monitored before having any future prospects in mind. The past one year has witnessed a tremendous decline in the net profit margin too and is a matter of concern. Though the company is making fairly good revenues, it is not able to cope with increasing expenses in the currently flourishing market.
It is significant to observe that the revenues of the company and in turn the total assets have seen a massive downfall in the year 2022 where it touched the 13911 Cr. Rs. mark. This is a point of concern as it might impact the overall equity growth of the company if the trend continues. However this has not impacted the net profit of the company and the company has been able to handle itself amidst lesser asset values too. The company has increased its book value and total equity along with maintaining a stable stock rate. It has also reduced its liabilities and proved to have a strong hold.
The revenue generated by the company has been balanced within an expected range throughout the past five years which is a sign of marked consistency from the part of the company. In 2023, it has seen a minor setback which is evident from its decreased opening cash balance. The company had reached a steady standpoint of cash flow generated from its investing activities in the year 2022 touching 6.33 Cr. Rs. post which it has again fallen prey to a significant deinvestment phase. This cycle is also observed in terms of its financial activities and there is a felt need to decrease liabilities and improve its assets to make the net change in balance of the company a surplus amount and help the company prosper.
Decreasing net profit margin over the years 2021-2023 from 18.54% to 14.54% is a sign of marked financial unstability of the company. The numbers have gone down significantly irrespective of the fact that the company has been able to maintain an upward curve in terms of revenue and EBITDA. The operational efficiency of the company is good enough and shows positive trends over the past five years, but the profit margin in the same domain is declining gradually. Overall the company has still a long way to go to reconsider its strategies and change the direction of the profit margin graph. Shareholders can keep optimistic prospects as it is still on the rise in terms of earnings per share and investors can keep faith on the numbers in the coming future.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has increased drastically in the year 2023 touching the 5831 Cr. Rs. mark. The current assets of the company seems to be on the rise which means that the company has seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has witnessed steep downfall in 2020 when it reached the  bottomline of 54.40 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had been going through a rough time in handling its liabilities and had degraded its financial situation. In recent years, the scenario has seen marked improvement and is in a much stable state.
The revenue curve as deciphered from the cash flow table is one with varying ups and downs over the span of 2019-2023. The company has been spending on excess cost overheads which has resulted in deinvestments and a decline of the cash flow from investing activities is observed. Positive cash flow from financial activities had been observed in the year 2021 but the company seems to have been running low on stocks and is under a critical state of loss. With the net balance in cash going tremendously low, the company is soon to face severe financial instability and it is enough to say that the company might deplete its current resources soon.
The upward growth in the revenue curve of the company gives a positive impression of the company in the past 5 years. The company seems to be steady at making improvements in its strategic plans and market plans. The rise is gradual but conspicuous. However, it is also to be noted that the company has not been able to handle its increasing expenses very well. The net profit margin overall has gone down 2021 to 2023 and last stands at 15.71% only as compared to the highest recorded value of 22.63%. Market worth of the company is also on the decline and shareholders will be facing a rough time. Dividends per share has gone down to 7 Rs. , thus this might not be the best choice ofr investors at the moment. Overall, the company needs to make amendments to its plan of actions nd budget handling strategies in order to compensate for the decline in profit margin and make more out of its increasing revenues.
It is remarkable from the given balance sheet of the company that there has been a significant increase in the total revenue generation of the company in the year 2019 to 2023. The company has, as a result, witnessed an upsurge in the total asset value upto 2023. Current assets of the company are fairly increasing which removes the doubt that the company needs to work on maintaining a short term in hand cash flow in order to support its operating activities. The total liabilities of the company have increased with time which needs to be remediated. There has been significant growth in the total equity possessed by the company which is a positive sign for the company in the long run. It has been able to maintain the stock on a consistent range and can thus gain the confidence and support of investors.
The numbers obtained from the table depict the trends in cash flow of the company and emphasise on the areas where the company has faced a setback over the years. It is evident from the numbers that the company has been mishandling assets and indulging in excess rebuy of stocks a result of which it has seen a huge dip in cash flow from financial activities over the yeras. The situation has improved as of 2023, but the numbers are still on the negative side. Investments have also resulted in more of losses as the cash flow from investing domains have also reduced by a large margin. This makes sure that the company has been making more of deinvestments or an optimization of resources to deliver maximum returns and hence facing a steep decline.
The table highlights the statistics of the company in the past three years from 2021-2023. It is imperative to note that though the company is making fairly good revenue over the years, it is at a poor status in terms of financial stabiliy and needs urgent revamping of its strategic plans. The net profit margin of the company is significantly on the decline from 10.06% in 2021 to 8.11% in 2022 to 6.90% in the year 2023. As the expenses of the company ison the rise, it is the need of the hour to bring about reorganisation or an improvement in their market strategies so as to balance the expenses and make a growth in its net profit margin. Earnings per share also do not show much variation, so shareholders should wait for better opportunities in the upcoming years. The same applies to investors as we see the dividends per share has dipped in the past one year.
The table depicts the comparison of asset values of the company across three years and is a testament of the fact that the company has been performing efficiently in maintaining its equity levels and increasing its book value over the years. The liabilitiies have piled up and needs to be paid back in time to avoid crisis. Thus it is necessary for the company to generate revenues at a greater margin to elevate its financial figures at a better rate.
The cashflow reports of the company in the past three years show some conspicuous points about the progress of the company over the years 2021-2023. In the past year the company has witnessed the financial activities go down by a drastic difference touching -287.10 Cr. Rs. thus indicating that the company is servicing debt. It has also undergone huge loss from investment activities and this has resulted in a steep downfall of its net cashflow balance. Thus despite a higher opening balance, the company has fallen back on its losses and is not at a very stable position to sustain itself.
The numbers depicted in the table throw light on the fact that the company seems to be going through a tough time in recent years as is evident from its net profit margin. The margin has dipped to 4.76% in the year 2022 and made a slight enhancement in the year 2023 where it reached 5.50%. Over the years, the revenue trend is seen gradual with the deepest low in the year 2021 when it reached a revenue of 5112 Cr. Rs. However, in the past one year, the status of the company has bloomed better and it has touched a revenue of 7569 Cr. Rs. Shareholders do have a good prospect with the company in recent times as its share values have increased from 6.66 Rs to 8.78 Rs earnings per share , indicating the profitability of the company in the past year. While the company status looks steady, it needs to be monitored with sheer optimism with any futuristic prospects.
The gradual upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of fair financial stability for the company in the years 2019-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name. The equity of the company has touched the 4560 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown decline in the year 2019 touching 63.39 Cr. Rs. post which the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value to 84.13 Cr. Rs. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The cash flow table throws light on the revenue curve of the company. It is evident that the company has gone down in the past one year and has faced challenges in revenue generation as a result of which the opening cash balance as of 2023 stands at a drastic low of -11.17 Cr. Rs. The rate of taking uncertain investment decisions has costed the company by a huge margin and the smae is observed from the sudden decline in cash flow from the investing activities in the yesr 2023. Though the company has been able to maintain a positive net balance owing to better grasp on the core operational domain, it should mend its investment and stock management strategies to prevent further decline.
The data from the table shows mixed numbers and variation in revenue trends in the past five years of the company. The year 2020-2021 had witnessed a slight downfall of the company in terms of revenue as expenses continued to increase. Thus the company faced a major setback in these years with reduced EBITDA value and hence, reduced operational efficiency. In the following years, the company has bucked up again to make a growth in terms of operational efficiency but seems to have undergone higher overhead costs on workforce as a result of which its net profit margin has slightly gone down. While shareholders can have faith on their market value, it would be imperative for the company to balance its operating and net profit margin in the coming years.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company in the year 2021, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself that year. There is a greater scope of potential growth with no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company had significantly decreased in the year 2023 reaching 1590 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had less debt to finance its operations efficiently. Thus the obligations of the company in recent years has slightly decreased and the current liabilities have touched the 1273 Cr. Rs. mark. A positive outlook of the company is presented by the steady growth of equity over the years which might have resulted from selling shares of stocks. Thus the company has grown significantly over the period and is in a stable position in the rapidly developing market.
The table depicted above gives a picture of the cash flow trends of a company over the years 2019-2023. The opening cash balance of the company demonstrates mixed numbers over the years but have been within the same range. The company has been able to generate a surplus margin of cash flow from its core activities in the year 2020 when it drastically touched 717.72 Cr. Rs. It is a matter of concern that the company's operating activities cash flow has declined gradually post 2020 which depicts that the company has comparitively lesser cash to sustain its day-to-day activities. The company also needs to reconstruct its investment areas so as to ensure a positive value of cash flow from its investing activities which will help escalate the net change in cash value over the years. However, the financial balance of the company thus provides a positive outlook in the past 2 years as is observed from a positive value of net cash flow. The company shall have excellent future prospects if this trend is maintained in the upcoming years.
The statistics of the company shows an exceptional rate of operating profit margin over the years with a minor dip in the year 2023. But however , it has been successful in maintaining a number above 88% all throughout the span of the past five years. However, the net profit margin of the company is increasing at a very slow rate with a minor downfall in the year 2021 where it reached 21.69% . The company has a lot to work on its strategical aspects to increase its net profit margin in the long run. Revenue trends show similar behaviour with ups and downs and expenses show the same trend which might indicate that the company had been going through performance setbacks in the year 2022. While the dividends per share and net worth of the company in the market show average growth, investors need to monitor the trends in numbers for making better decisions.
The revene generated by the company has enabled the company to fund for itself and increase the total assets of the company over the years. The liabilities need to be toned down , oterwise it can lead to a state of loss for the company and it might run into debt. Handling this should be the prime focus of the company at this stage. Common stock values have maintained a consistent figure which can attract shareholders and the company should look forward to gaining the confidence of its investors better.
The data fetched from the table shows concerning numbers of the net change in cash as the company seems to have touched the -726.13 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2022. This highlights a dropdown in the company profits and is a risk in the path of sustainable growth. The opening cash balance of the company has been on the growth until 2022, post which it has seen a minor dip, so it is needless to say that the company is doing moderately fine in terms of revenue generation every consistent year. The negative value of cash flow generated from operating activities depicts that the company has failed to accumulate cash from its prominent operations on a daily basis and is on the negative side. A lot of work is still needed on the investment front as the cash from investing activities is on the decline. This emphasises the need to reform its investment plans to maintain a higher net change in cash.
The year 2021 saw a slight sink in the company's revenue and correspondingly its operational efficiency. While this had an impact on the net profit and earnings per share of the company, the overall profit margin was steadily balanced. Positive trends have been observed in revenue from the following year onwards. Expenses have been going at par with the amount of revenue generated. EBITDA data and the net profit margin in recent years show an optimistic variation. Shareholders have good prospects with the company as the earnings per share currently stand at a stable position. As dividends per share values show proper growth, it would be beneficial for investors to keep a check on the pattern before embarking into a long term prospective with the company.
From the given table, transitions in asset management trends that the company has witnessed in the last five years is quite prominent. The company has some significant amount to repay to its creditors. The count of liabilities need to be curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been growing in the same range which might be a part of the companies future growth investment. The total equity of the company has a massive rise in the last one year touching 1400 Cr. Rs. , and is a positive sign for all its shareholders. The debt to equity values of the company has seen a slight increase in the past year which might raise concerns on the fact that the company owes money to other businesses. This number needs to be maintained in the long run and the company needs to reform its business strategies in order to make the numbers count.
The overall analysis of the cash flow table of the company does not present a very impressive picture of the company in recent times. The company has been seen lagging in terms of revenue generation, and has decreased its opening balance to 3.61 Cr. Rs from 6.61 Cr. Rs. The rate of deinvestments and losses from stock market has proved to have a detrimental effect on the company. This cash flow from operating activities has been fairly maintained at a high level, so the company seems to be doing fine in terms of its day-to-day activities. It is a need of the hour that the company indulges itself in accumulating cash and works on improving its financial flexibility to overcome the liquidity challenge sit is currently facing.
The progress of the company in the past 5 years has been overall gradual. The revenue range has been maintained and has increased slowly. While expenses and revenue seem to go hand in hand, the company is maintaining a failrly profitable operating margin which indicates its investment on resources and workers. Progressing values of EBITDA is a sign of increasing production and efficiency for the company. However, it can aim at better strategies to increase its net profit margin at a faster rate. Shares have gone up high to 32.69 Rs. earnings per share which shows how the net worth of the company in the market is growing. Thus the company can touch better positions in the market if it maintains the same trend over time.
The data generated from the table throw light on the trend in balance statement parameters of a particular company. The company has hardly been in a state of debt which is definitely a plus point to prove the stability of the company in the past 5 years. It has thus been able to increase its production and efficiency. The total asset values have seen a gradual increase over the years. Hand in hand, total liabilities have also increased with time and it is a felt need of the hour to mitigate these values. Failing to compensate for these might let the company into a state of loss. Stock prices of the company have been in an overall consistent range as a result of which the company has been making profit and has been able to win the trust of shareholders.
The latest trends of cash flow data deciphered from the table indicate a subtle state of risk the company is in. It had been generating fairly good amount of revenues until 2020 but has faced a severe drop in the following years. This might eye to a sudden decrease in market base for the products or the services the company is rendering to its customers. this has affected the net stocks value of the company and is not suitable enough to neutralize the losses sufferred from investing sectors. Thus the net balance has declined to 1.21 Cr. Rs. and might take the company to a criticla stand point if the situation does not improve conspicuously in the next year.
From the given table it is evident that the company has seen a reduction in its overall revenue in the year 2021 when it touched 2611 Cr. Rs. and gradually upscaled post 2021 to make up for the loss. It is to be noted that its expenses have been changing by the same margin. The company had badly gone down in the year 2021 with a negative net profit margin and has been steadily getting back to form post the downfall. With increase in revenues the EBITDA data also shows rise in operational efficiency. Shareholders have good prospects as the company earnings have risen to  29.85 Rs per share and is indicative of how the company is regaining its hold in the existing market. Overall, the company has shown remarkable progress in the past 2 years and can be a peak spot of interest for investors.
The information drawn from the given table represents the bank statement of a company and shows the huge financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2018 to 2023, finally touching 2132 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands as low as 0.44 which depicts a reduction in the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting a tremendous positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run.
The data fetched form the given table throw light on the fact that the company has been struggling in terms of maintaining a steady upward curve for the net change in cash balance. This might indicate lower rate of profits or ove rinvestment in the uncertain areas. As of 2023, the net change in cash has touched down to -3.93 Cr. Rs. , the lowest in the past five years and this is a point of marked concern for all its shareholders. The company has been at a much better position in the year 2022 and had been and previously in 2019, post which the effect of deinvestments had begun to influence the progress of the company.
The financial reports of the company illustrate an exceptional performance of the company over the past 5 years in terms of revenue generation, sales and enhanced operational efficiency. Expenses have been on the rise too. While the company has strived to maintain a more or less same range of operational profit margin, the net profit margin has seen comparitively more variations in the past five years. The company will be a go-to place for shareholders and investors as is evident from its escalating value of earnings per share. With the profit before tax on the increasing end, the company is quite at a stable position in the current market scenario.
With a sheer positive growth in total asset values, the company has exhibited an extraordinary performance in the year 2023when its total assets have touched the 4697 Cr. Rs. mark. The company also has enough of inflowing cash to cover up its short term prospects and make a stable operational environment in the company. With the book value and stock values making a significant rise, the company is ready to gain investors to fund itself in the upcoming days.
The values obtained from the table shown are indicative of the fluctuations in the cash flow trends of the company in the past five years which is a measure of the financial strength and stability of the company. While the company has been able to accumulate good margin of cash every year for an opening balance, it has not been able to maintain the same upward growth in terms of the investing cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities has reached a high of 609.30 Cr. Rs. which depicts that the core functionalities of the company are going on in full swing. There is a remarkable improvement in the investment front that the company has shifted from the negative cash flow to a positive range indicating that the strategic investments have been materialised. While the company has excelled in maintaining  a steady upward growth of cash flow generated from its investments, a little effort on the part of escalating its financial profit margin would set the net change to a more stable state.
This company has maintained remarkable consistency in revenue generation over the years with reaching its highest value in 2023. Expenses have been going hand in hand and needs to be cut down to improve the net profit margin which is going down eventually. The company has also become less profitable in the market in the past year with its earnings per share showing a drop, while its increasing dividend show a strong committment to investors that can prove to be beneficial in the long run.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company till the year 2023, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself. There is a greater scope of potential growth as there is no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company had significantly increased in the year 2023 reaching 1891 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company has significant debt in the path of financing its operations. However the obligations of the company in recent years has increased and the debt to equity has touched the 0.37 mark. A slight negative outlook of the company is presented by this increasewhich might hamper the growth of the company in the rapidly developing market.
Summing up the observations from the table, we see that the company has been progressing with a varying margin of opening cash balance all throughout the years. It had tried to get over the uncleared debts and make a significant improvement in financial activities in the year 2022 but has touched down the -206.33 Cr. Rs. bottomline again. Thus the decline is more conspicuous in this case. It has been able to revamp its investment plans a little in the past one year as a result of which the cash flow from investing activities has become a little better in the past year, but it has a lot of efforts to be made in order to neutralise the net negative change in cash and strengthen its financial assets.
The data shown in the table depicts that the company is capable of attracting investors with its positive trends in dividends per share. It has also been able to maintain a consistent value of EPS over the years with slight ups and downs. However there is a felt need to reorganise the strategic areas of the company as the net profit margin seems to be dropping despite an increase in revenue. Better management of additional costs and overheads can prove to be helpful in such a situation. Operational strategies seem to be flourishing as is prominent from the EBITDA data and hopefully will be showing the same trend down the line.
From the given table, transitions in asset management trends that the company has witnessed in the last five years is quite prominent. The company has some amount to repay to its creditors. The count of liabilities need to be curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been on the rise which might be a part of the companies future growth and investment strategy. The total equity of the company has a massive rise in the last one year touching 2480 Cr. Rs. , and is a positive sign for all its shareholders. The debt to equity values of the company has seen a slight increase in the past year which might raise concerns on the fact that the company owes money to other businesses. This number needs to be maintained in the long run and the company needs to reform its business strategies in order to make the numbers count.
A notable aspect about the data fetched from the table is the fact that the company has tremendously increased the cashflow from its fibnancial activities in the past year and hopefully will continue to maintain this upward growth. This sheds light on the proper management of assets and timely repurchase of stocks. thus, the company has no such chances of being in a state of debt. However the cash flow from investing activities has taken a sudden decline indicating the excess investments of the company or maybe the company has been making long term investments for a sustainable future.
The year 2020 has been the lowest point in the financial progress of the company. The company had sufferred a huge loss of -68.43% and correspondingly a negative value of EBITDA is observed. The company must have witnessed a tough time in generating sales and in management of labour. Its share values also saw negative trends in the competitive market. In the following years, the company has revived by a good margin and this is evident from its revenue count and net profit. The earnings per share has gone down in the past year, but considering its reviving phase investors can make their decisions with subtle optimism.
The data seen above shows that the compnay had faced slight challenges in maintaining an upward growth and financial stability in the year 2020 when its equity value touched the mark 9987 Cr. Rs. Ever since, it has been a centre of attraction for shareholders and investors as the total assets along with the book values of the company have been constantly on the rise. Thus, it is a good prospect to hold shares in this company as the company is heading slowly to reach higher levels of glory.
The revenue curve of the company as depicted from the cash flow table is a remarkable one. The company has been maintaining an open balance of negative figures in the years 2019-2022 but has upscaled efficiently in the year 2023 touching the 315.35 Cr. Rs. mark. The company seems to be performing well in terms of maintaining a balanced cash flow from its day to day activities but needs more improvement in making more strategic investment plans. The asset management plans of the company seem to have failed terribly as we see a gradual decrease in cash flow from its financial activities over the years. With positive figures of net change in cash in 2021-2022, the steep decline in 2023 makes a huge difference.
The overall financial status of the company shows mixed numbers. The year 2020 had seen a decline of the company in terms of revenues and net  profit incurred. The company's expenses had also gone down by huge margin which might indicate that the company did not have a good market for its products. In the years 2021-2023, the company's market revived by a good deal and it regained its foothold with high revenues. Profit margin considerably increased in 2022 but shows a dip in the last year. This points to a probable lack of management or inefficiency of workforce as a result of which the company is committed to excess of overhead expenses. It is also not a profitable front for investors and shareholders at this point to plan for future prospects with this company.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2021-2023. The burning rate of total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. However it is a key point that the book value of the company has gone done by some margin over the year 2020 reaching 53.53 Cr. Rs. This needs to be analysed as it might hint to a fluctuating market scenario or likewise. Stock rates of this company have gone down which is a parameter that might not attract shareholders in the long run if this trend in decline persists.
The opening cash balance of the company shows varying trends. It is seen that the company revenues have gone up and down gradually over the years which might point to an inconsistency in its revenues or market demand. This needs to be analysed in order to ensure better rates of net cash balance that the company holds for its sustainable growth at the end of the year. As per the current trends, the company has been prey to a number of excess expenditures and has not been performing impressively in managing its financial assets. This has resulted in a straight decrease in its overall balance in the year 2023 to -349.51 Cr. Rs. which is a mark of concern.
The table depicts an exceptional rise in prosperity of the company over the years with a gradual escalation in revenue generation. The company has been extremely successful in balancing its increasing expenses and at the same time, enhancing its operational productivity. However, in the past one year the company has dipped in net profit margin by a huge leap and this is an issue to be tracked. It indicates the influx of too many overhead expenses or hidden charges which the company has to incur. This is a matter of concern for shareholders too as the earnings per share have dropped down to half in the past year. It would be a wise decision for investors with future prospects with this company to closely evaluate the deviation in profit margin before investing in the company.
The rise in assets of the company over the years denotes a marked sense of prosperity for the company as it indicates that the company has been trying to expand its ventures and gain hold of more and more assets. As of 2023, the total assets of the company have touched the 19372 Cr. Rs. mark and have enough financial stability so as to not depend on external investors or companies for its operational activities. The total liabilities of the company have seen a dip in the year 2022 when it touched the 7645 Cr. Rs. base which denotes that the company had been working on loan repayments and clearing off liabilities to its creditors. The company has the sheer support of investing firms as its stock values are constantly on the rise and its book value has also shown remarkable enhancement in 2023 touching 335.75 Cr. Rs.
The financial stability of the company is clearly measured from the data in the table which shows an overall positive net change in cash over the years but the figures have seen fluctuations. The company has bene provided with a handsome opening cash balance over teh years and has also maintained a sustainability in its day-to-day businesses. The financial activities have resulted in poor turnover which might indicate inability to make payments to suppliers and inconsistent management of stocks. The investment profits are also negatively impacting the company's financial performance. A recovery phase from these downfalls would enable the company to mantain greater cash in hand and sustain itself better in the long run.
The financial report of the company demonstrates mixed numbers. The company had fallen off in terms of revenue and wealth generation in the year 2021, following which it has made constant improvement to re-establish its foothold in the market. The current market profitability of the company stands highest in the past 5 years and will draw the attention of investors with increased value of dividends per share. Overall the company looks at a stable financial state and can sustain the current market competition with its adequate operational efficiency.
The year 2023 has witnessed a sheer upgrade in the total assets of the company as the company touched the 10148 Cr. Rs. mark. Increased generation of current assets are necessary to handle short term fulfillments of obligations. The fluctuating trend in the total liabilities show that the company has reduced its outstanding liabilities to 737.83 Cr. Rs. which is a positive sign. As of recent years the company has been performing well and has been able to establish its market strength with a good margin of total equity and book value.
The revenue generation curve of the company over the past 5 years has been an interesting one. The company has been able to make increasing revenues over the phase 2019-2021 but has been significantly going down in next years. The same trend has been followed in its operating activity cash flow and the positive values demonstrate that the company has been able to generate enough cash for its day to day activities. The only drawback of the company is the fact that it is undergoing stock repurchases or extensive cash outflow which has decreased the income from financing activities. If this value is mitigated from draining, the net balance of the company will be at a much higher positive rate.
A remarkable point to be noted from the table data is the variation in the net profit margin made by the company over the years. The company had reached an extremely low point in the year 2021 with a net profit margin of  5.33% but has consequently made persistent efforts to regain the steady number in the past 2 years. The ratio between revenues and expenses has been consistent over the years which is a sign of efficiency and enhanced capability. The operational profit margin also focus more on a positive trend ensuring that the company is performing well in terms of management and leads generation. The EPS values illustrate a positive trend and will attract investors, making it more profitable in the coming years.
The balance statement of the company as seen in the first five years period indicates an amazing performance in the last one year. The debt to equity values have seen a significant rise and it is notable that the total equity of the company has increased which reflects the financial progress of the company. It has also been involved in long term investment plans and needs to implement debt mitigation strategies as is evident from the rapidly increasing total liabilities. Irrespective of the vast proportion of assets, the company has witnessed a drastic upsurge in the debt to equity values and overall the company looks to be at a struggling position to maintain a lower debt in the upcoming years.
The financial stability of the company as depicted by the figures on its cash flow statement clearly indicates the downfall of the company in recent years. The net cash flow balance of the company has been dropping down to negative figures and thus the company is no more at an upper hand. Though the opening balance has increased ove rthe years, the revenue generated has been neutralised by the drastic loss the company has been making over the years. The operating activities have faced a steep decline which throws a concern on the sustainability of the business on a daily basis. The company has been prey to prominent deinvestments and inefficiency in stock repayment which has let the financial cash flows down too. Thus, the overall balance of the company still stands at negative values and is not a sign of prosperity of the company in the long run.
The numbers in the table indicate a fair increase in revenue generated by the company until 2022 followed by a negligible variation in the year 2023. Overall, the company stands at a steady state and is improvising on its strategic plans. It has shown commendable improvement in upgrading its operational facets and thus, making a gradual increase in the net income. Recent trends demonstrate a downward slope in its net profit margin and earnings per share value, which clearly proves that the company has to pull up its socks and make efforts to stand the current market competition.
There has been a marked improvement in the total assets of the company in the year 2022 when the value touched 13646 Cr. Rs. The company has a fair hold on its current assets which lay emphasis on the idea that the company is sustainable enough to manage its daily operational activities efficiently. The increasing rate of liabilities raises questions on the survival of the company in the future without resorting into a state of debt. The priority of the company at the moment should be to clear off its outstanding debts which have piled up over the years as is reflected by the debt to equity value of 3.27. The company shall have the support of investors in this process who might be holding prospects at the high book value of the company as of 2023.
The statistical data obtained from the table makes it clear that the company has been performing moderately well in revenue generation and has gone through highs and lows in the past 5 years. While the company had been making good enough money from its operating activities in the year 2019, the value has consequently declined and settled in negative figures over the years. This might indicate that the core busines activities of the company have not been thriving and the company is facing challenges in reaching its daily business goals. The performance of the company is poor due to significant amounts of cash being invested in the long-term health of the company and needs to be cut down. Morover the companyneed sto improve on its daily business operations so that the draining cash flow from its operating activities can balance the net profit margin.
With a subtle increase in revenue over the years, the data shown in the table indicates that the company has followed a strategic pattern for increasing its sales over the years. However, it has not been able to simultaneously balance the increasing expenses and operational aspects which has a detrimental impact on the net profit margin of the company. The fluctuation in EBITDA values hint at a lack of right operational strategies and planning. The company might have incurred too much of overhead and hidden expenses which has resulted in a dip in its profit generated. The company's marlet value is also to be questioned as the earnings per share shows fluctuating numbers over the years. Though the rise in dividends per share give some hope that the company can sustain and maintain growth in the future, investors need to monitor the company statistics for quite a while before making a decision to invest in this company.

The opening cash balance of the company as of 2019 stood at null and void, which is indicative of the fact that the company had not been doing very well in terms of revenue generation. But it is to be significantly noted that the despite suffering great loss in terms of cash flow from operating and investment activities, the company stood out in achieving a positive cashflow from its financial activities which helped the company gain good profit. Th ecompany might have gained the support of investors or might have been in its early stage to start with. In the following years, the company has made plenty of deinvestments but has shown similar trends in maintaining its stability in purchasing and rebuying of stocks which has boosted up the positive assets of the company. In short, the company seems to be at a steady state in terms of net profit but can elevate itself by ensuring a higher cash flow from its investment activities.
The data from the table depicts a mixed trend in the revenue growth of the company, with 2021 witnessing the lowest phase of the company followed by a steady growth. While the company has been able to maintain a steady operational margin, the net profit margin shows minor ups and downs. From the perspective of shareholders, the company is at a worthwhile position. It is beneficial to hold shares in the company considering its current state. The trend in its dividends per share demonstrate a peculiar variation. The dividends had reached its peak value in the year 2020 but have dropped by a heavy margin in the following years and has been continued to be at its lowest point in the past three years. Investors thus might be unattracted to this huge deviation in the rate of dividends.
The upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of prosperity for the company in the years 2019-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name which can be converted to cash without a significant loss in value. The equity of the company has touched the 2037 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown a straight dip in the year 2021 touching 178.61 Cr. Rs. post which the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value to 270.83 Cr. Rs. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
Over the years, the company has witnessed a negative figure of cashflow from investing activities which indicates that the company has paid out capital, such as retiring or paying off long-term debt or making a dividend payment to shareholders. This rate of decline iis seen to be fluctuating amd slightly improving in the recent years. The financial activities have also generated a negative cash flow but is declining at a lesser rate. Since the company is able to maintain its core activities at a steady pace, the operating activities are well managed. This cash flow generated form this domain has been a boon to the company in balancing the net loss faced by the company form other activities. As a result, the net cash flow of the company has touched 280.55 Cr. Rs. as of 2023, the highest in the past 5 years.
The trends in financial numbers of the company demonstrate a sustained development of the company in terms of revenues over the years. As expenses are continuously on the rise, the company seems to be spending on resources and workforce to maintain the upward revenue curve. However, there has been fluctuations in the net profit margin and rate of operational profit that throws light on the lack of management or need for reconsideration of the company's plan of action. Shareholders are at a risk as the numbers for earnings per share seem to be dropping gradually and so is the rate of dividends per share. It might not be very profitable for investors to invest in the company at this point until there is a marked upsurge in numbers in the future.

The data shown lays stress on the need to reorganise the investment strategies if the company and find better deals to make its investments fruitful. In the past 5 years, the company has faced huge rate of deinvestments which has resulted in a net lowering of its change in cash. The company is losing money which can be indicative of poor timing of income and expenses. This has led the company to a state of debt. The net cash balance has been almost null in 2023 and raises the concerns for improved planning of repurchase of stocks and money-lending activities.
The data shown in the table makes it evident that the company has been making remarkable progress in recent years after witnessing a minor decline in efficiency and profitability in the year 2020. Revenues and expenses have been increasing hand in hand but balanced enough to make the net profit margin count. Its increasing earnings per share demonstrate the company's committment to its shareholders. It is equally fruitful for investors as the dividends per share show positive variations. In the process of upgrading its operational strategies, the company stands at a good position in the market.
The information drawn from the given table represents the bank statement of a company and shows the huge financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2018 to 2023, finally touching 2162 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands as low as 0.55 comparable to the previous years which reduces the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting an overall positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run.
The overall analysis of the cash flow table of the company does not present a very impressive picture of the company in recent times. Though the company has been able to generate sufficient revenues and has increased its opening balance to 422.11 Cr. Rs, the rate of deinvestments and losses from stock market has proved to have a detrimental effect on the company. This cash flow from operating activities has been fairly maintained at a high level, so the company seems to be doing fine in terms of its day-to-day activities. It is a need of the hour that the company indulges itself in accumulating cash and works on improving its financial flexibility to overcome the liquidity challenge sit is currently facing.
The year 2021 saw a slight sink in the company's revenue and correspondingly its operational efficiency. While this had an impact on the net profit and earnings per share of the company, the overall profit margin was steadily balanced. Positive trends have been observed in revenue from the following year onwards. Expenses have been going at par with the amount of revenue generated. EBITDA data and the net profit margin in recent years show an optimistic variation. Shareholders have good prospects with the company as the earnings per share currently stand at a stable position. As dividends per share values show minor deviations, it would be beneficial for investors to keep a check on the pattern of the changes before embarking into a long term prospective with the company.

The data obtained from the table depicts the financial progress of the company which has been struggling to maintain a net profit in cashflow for the last four years. The company had been performing efficiently and was able to maintain a net profit balance of 137.13 Cr. Rs. in the year 2019, following which we observe a drastic downfall of the numbers. The decline might have improved a little over the years but the numbers still stand at a very poor margin. This is an effect of the huge loss incurred from the financial activities it is involved in. The stock rates might have gone against their preferences as a result of which there has been a tremendous mismanagement of stocks. Investments have also seen a donwfall in recent years which mostly eye to deinvestments thatis bring the financial stability of the company down.
The company faced a massive decline in June 2020 with its operational efficiency, net profit and earnings per share touching its lowest point in the past five years. The revenue of the company had gone down exponentially too. In the month of December of the same year, the company steadily regained its form and made a drastic hike in revenues and operational profit margin. However net profit margin continued to remain low overall. The company needs to be reconsidering its strategies as the latest records show higher expenses than generated revenues which in turn leads the company to a state of loss. Though the earnings per share has improved lately, the company needs to make amendments to escalate its net profit margin.
A close analysis of the financial report of the company brings us to the conslusion that over the years from 2019 to 2023, the net profitability of the company has gone down drastically from 47.85 earnings per share to 8.14. The same trend is visible with respect to the dividends per share of the company. An analysis of the company market value is required if anyone has thoughts of investment in this company. However the company has continued to maintain a steady growth in revenues over the years and is consistent in terms of profit. Its operational efficiency looks good too. With the expenses on the rise, the company has also generated enough revenue to balance the two.
From the given table it is a matter to concentrate on the fact that the company has been making significant progress over the years in terms of total revenue generation, which is evident from the figures of its total assets. The year 2023 has seen an increase in the total asset value by a huge margin when it touched 15537 Cr. Rs. The non current liabilities is a depiction that the company has recently increased its long term investment and thus it relies on external resources for funding. Liabilities of the company has increased with time which needs to be monitored and cut down at the earliest. The company also has a good amount of non current liability in its name. This might include long term debt which in the future can put the company at a financial risk. The debt to equity of the company seems to have increased a little bit with time which is not a positive sign as the company is then dependent on its creditors as it was in the past year. Thus the company has been maintaining a good asset margin, but it would be good for it to look into the book value figures which had drastically declined in the year 2022 to 49.61 Cr. Rs.
The figures obtained form the cash flow table given is demonstrative of a fairly positive financial status of the company. The company has been able to maintain positive cash balance across the years which indicates an adequate revenue generation plan. The operating activities were depicting decent numbers in 2021-2022 but has recently declined in the year 2023 to -167.83 Cr. Rs.. This might point to a sudden shortage of cash to repay its creditors or to find the financing of its asset replacement or business expansion. Investment strategoes of the company might have been reorganised or the market scenario might have improved in the last year as a result of which the company is able to generate good enough cash from investing activities in the past year. Overall, neglecting the steep fall in net cash balance of the ocmpany in the year 2019 and 2021, the company has been rapidly progresisng and is at a profitable state.
The financial report of the company demonstrates that the company is undergoing a rough time in terms of its profit, performance and efficiency. Though it has been able to maintain a steady growth in revenues untill 2022, the year 2023 has seen a downfall of the company by a huge margin. The EBITDA has fallen to negative values, which clearly indicates that the company's operating expenses are higher than its revenue and this is a matter of sheer concern. The net profit margin touching -6.33% reflects how the production costs have been tremendously higher than the revenues generated. Thus, the company immediately needs a reorganisation of its plans to gain a steady foothold in the market. As the share values and dividends per share of the company continue to decrease, investors should think twice before looking forward to any future plans with this company.

The data fetched from the cash flow reports of the company show mixed numbers and a slight upward growth of the company in the last one year. This is indicated by the overall net balance retained in the company at the end of the year. The company semeed to have been running low on profit from its operational activities in the year 2023 which was steadily balanced by the cash flow from its financial activities. This deviation in the latest financial cash flow is indeed a positive drift as the company seemed to have upscaled by a huge margin after having a streak of negative figures aross four years.
The data in the table shows that the company had been struggling to upscale its revenues over the years 2019-2021 as is evident from the declining numbers. In 2022, it reached the peak point of its progress curve with the highest revenue and consequently the highest net profit margin. The company also had a commendable market value with maximum earnings per share in the past 5 years. However, the performance of the company is on the decline in the past one year. The net profit margin has decreased to half of its peak value and the value of its shares has dipped too. However, the consistency in its dividends per share over time can give investors some confidence that the company's management believes that its earnings growth can be sustained.

The table demonstrates the cash flow trends of a company in the past five years which highlights its performance in terms of the net cash earned. The net balance of the company which represents the financial stability and future sustainability of the company shows fluctuating numbers. The value had reached negative figures every consecutive year and is impacted by the hige decline of cash flow from its financial activities. The company might have been in debt or is not making enough profit from its stock exchanges which is taking the company down the curve. While the income from its operational sectors is going fine in the upward direction, it is the need of the hour to revamp the company's investment plans and stock related ventures for the future growth of the company.
The numbers depicted in the table throw light on an interetsing facet of the company. The company has been performing exceptionally well with a steady upsurge in revenue over the years, but its net profit margin is on the decline. This highlights that the company is following an ineffective cost structure or poor pricing strategy. With its expenses on the rise, it is the need of the hour that the company revises its strategic plans to maintain a numeric balance. While EBITDA values show mixed trends, the dividends per share of the company shows proper consistency. The company is struggling to maintain its profitability in the market as is evident from fluctuating values of its earnings per share. Probably, restructuring of its strategies might help the company to stabilize itself in the long run.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain an increase in its total equity over the years. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. Current assets of the company has also touched a fairly good mark of 1528 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company has enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. It has always been on the increase except in 2019 when it witnessed a sudden decline in total assets. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation in the year 2019 or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has been consistent throughout, the book value has seen slow growth which is also a positive sign for the company in the long run. Investors might look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
The data obtained from the table throws light on a various aspects of the company and its trends in financial parameters. The opening cash flow balance being positive throughout the year, we can conclude that the company can generate sufficient positive cash flow to maintain and grow its operations. This is indeed a positive sign. The investment curve of the company shows fluctuating values over the years and does not represent a very stable investment plan. The cash flow from its investing activities have gone down to -961.76 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023 which is a blocker in the path of growth and more profit. While the company had been facing challenges in maintaining its financing cash throughout 2019-2022, the year 2023 2023 has seen a sudden upsurge in its cash flow from financing activities touching 356.54 Cr. Rs. which instills some hope for a brighter future for the company.
The trends in financial numbers of the company demonstrate a fluctuation in revenue in the year 2019-2021. However in the past three years, the company seems to have pulled up its socks to generate higher revenue. It is to be noted that the expenses of the company are on the rise which in turn might lead to ups and downs in the net profit margin. Currently, the company is progressing steadily and the data shows mixed trends. While the earnings per share of the company is rising gradually, its net profitability has increased over the years which is indeed a positive news for its shareholders. Investors with future prospects with this company should closely monitor the surge in expenses and make their choice.

The trends visible from the given table presents an overall mixed outlook of the company as is represented by the fluctuating rates of the net change in cash. The company has been able to maintain a positive opening cash balance over the years which is a sign that the company is generating more revenue than its expenditures. It has bene able to maintain a balance in this area, which is a plus point for the company. It has also been able to significantly balance its cash flow from operating activities and has generated enough cash from its core activities. The company has been performing fairly well in terms of making strategic investments and has made positive figures form its investments from 2019-2022. In 2023, the cash flow from its investing activities has dropped to -11.64 Cr. Rs. which is to be monitored as this might indicate that the company is running into debt or undergoing buybacks of stocks. This has impacted the net change in cash balance of the company which does not provide a very impressive picture of the financial prosperity of the company.
With an escalating net profit margin over the years, the company has shown tremendous growth. Its increasing expenses make sure that the company is investing more on its resources to ensure a higher operational efficiency. Revenue growth is at par with its rising expenses, which has helped the company to maintain a balance in its net profit margin over the years. The EBITDA data shows overall positive trends.  Shareholders of this company have an upper hand as the earnings per share are growing in numbers. Overall, the company is at a financially stable condition in the market and has good enough future prospects to establish a strong hold in the market.

It is notable to analyse the sudden chnage in dynamics of the net cash balance of the company in the past year when the company has been performing excellently in terms of its operational activities and have made huge cash out of its core activities, however the steep decline in cash flow from investing activities. There has a lot of work to be done on the stocks and repayment area has the financing activities is not seen to have made significant contribution to the growth of the company and is constantly on the decline. The company also have to relook into its investment strategies as pe rthe last year report, otherwise the financial stability of the company might be hampered in the long run.
The statistics shown in this table prove that the company had been rising steadily in the years 2019-2021 post which there has been a gradual decline in its overall profit margin and dividends per share. Thus, the performance of the company lately has been that of an utter concern. Reducing expenses in the past one year eyes at cost-cutting and reduction of resources or workforce in the company which has impacted its revenue and market value. Unfortunately the company does not stand at par with the recent evolving market which might attract less investors in the long run.
The information drawn from the given table represents the bank statement of a company and shows the huge financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2018 to 2023, finally touching 4428 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands as low as 0.13 which has increased the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting a positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run keeping in mind the emergency to repay its debt.
The year 2019 had witnessed a poor inflow from operating activities of the company as is shown from the data given. This highlights the fact that the organisation has not been operating profitably and is short of cash to repay its creditors. With the coming years, there have been improvements at the operational level and the company has been able to make better gains. The cash flow from investing activities need to be looked into as this is seen to affect the net cash flow of the company. Also, the company seems to be in a state of debt or is involved in stock buybacks as a result of which its cash flow from financing activities is going down with time. A prominent aspect to be noted here is the vast difference in the net change in cash balance for the year 2023 which gives some hope for a positive transition of the company in the recent years.
The company's financial report depicts a noteworthy aspect. Its net profit margin witnessed slow growth over the years till 2022 but drastically decreased to 4.19% in 2023, which is a matter of concern for its investors lately. The company might run into a state of loss if this rate of decline prevails in the long run. There has been a remarkable increase in revenue from 2019 to 2023 with a minor decline in the year 2021. Thus, there is a high margin of products or services that the company is able to sell across to its customers. Further, the downfall of operating profit margin can pose a threat to its overall operational efficiency. As a result, the company's financial performance has been mixed in recent years. While its revenue has grown, its profitability and share dividends have declined and needs to be monitored.
With a sudden increase in total assets over the years the company has finally reached the total asset mark of 14595 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. Non current assets of the company are essential in the long run and help in the companies financial support when a company is pressurized by liabilities. The trend in the total liabilities of the company has seen a positive growth which lays emphasis on the fact that the company has a lot to repeat back to its creditors and other businesses. Increase in liability might cause a serious setback for the company if the same trend prevails. The company is at a moderately financially stable state as the total equity of the company is on the rise and common stock values have also not declined. However the debt to equity values of the company as of 2023 have increased and now stand at 0.63 which is a mark of concern for its investors as the company is currently running into a state of debt.
The statistics report of the company obtained from the table is indicative of the cash flow trends witnessed by the company in the past five years from 2019-2023. It is to be highlighted that in 2019, the company had started with an opening cash balance of -170.08 Cr. Rs., which indicates that the company did not have sufficient funds in the account as a result of maintenance or other overhead deductions. However with progressing years, the company has maintained a positive opening cash balance which is definitely an indication of betterment in the financial status of the company. The company had reached its peak cash flow from operating margin in the year 2021 when it touched 1892 Cr. Rs. and has been able to maintain positive figures for the same throughout. Hence, the company has a good hold on its core operations and sustainability. While it has been able to perform at the same rate in terms of financing its stocks too, the year 2021 had seen a drastic low in its cash flow from financial activities. Overall, the company has been successful in maintaining a positive ratio of its opening to closing cash balance over the years which is a marked sign of prosperity for the company. In the year 2023, the excess decline in cash flow from investing activities led to a slight imbalance and brought about a deviation in the net change in cash value which needs to be moderated over the years.
The companyâ€™s income statement shows its financial performance in the past 5 years with the revenue showing a minor dip in 2020 touching 2,365 Cr. Rs. and then increasing steadily until 2022 to 4,316 Cr. Rs. The year 2023 has witnessed another slight decline in revenues, throwing light on the companyâ€™s slow growth. Expenses have increased by greater margins 2022 onwards reaching 2,701 Cr. Rs. and thus, resulting in decreased profit margin. Positive EPS in 2021-2022 signals profitability per share which is crucial for shareholders. The companyâ€™s commitment to maintain a constant value of 10.00 Rs. of dividends per share demonstrates an overall balance in the company. Thus, the company statistics reflect a steady growth with recent slowdown which hints at a decline of performance and operational efficiency. Investors with future prospects with this company should hold cautious optimism.
It is remarkable from the given balance sheet of the company that there has been a significant escalation in the total revenue generation of the company in the year 2023. The company has, as a result, witnessed an upward growth in the total asset value in the year 2023. It has not been able to totally compensate for the liabilities in the recent years. Current assets of the company are fairly on the rise which clears all questions regarding whether the company will be able to sustain its operational needs. There has been significant increase in the total equity possessed by the company which gives us a sense of optimism for the company in the long run. It has been able to maintain the stock on a consistent range and can still gain the confidence and support of investors as it has touched a higher book value as per the recent trends.

The company has been able to generate a surplus margin of cash flow from its core activities in the year 2020 when it drastically touched 951.72 Cr. Rs. It is a matter of concern that the company's operating activities cash flow has declined at a steep rate as of 2023 which depicts that the company does not have enough cash to sustain its day-to-day activities. The company also needs to reconstruct its investment areas so as to ensure a positive value of cash flow from its investing activities which will help escalate the net change in cash value over the years. However, the financial balance of the company thus provides a positive outlook as is observed from a positive value of net cash flow over the years.

The cash flow from investing activities need to be looked into as this is seen to affect the net cash flow of the company. Though the operating activities have ensured a positive cashflow in recent years, the numbers can be further enhanced. Also, the company seems to have been in a state of debt in 2022 or had been involved in stock buybacks as a result of which its cash flow from financing activities had gone down. A prominent aspect to be noted here is the vast difference in the net change in cash balance as compared to the year 2022 which gives some hope for a positive transition of the company in the recent years.

As the total equity stands at a fairly high margin in the recent years, we can conclude that the company is progressing steadily and has been able to reduce its debt to equity margin by a good number to 87.67 Cr. Rs.
It is evident from the table that the investing activities of the company have witnessed a massive decline in numbers until 2020 which is a sign that the investments of the company had generated lesser returns than expected, thus leading the company to a state of loss.

The company has been able to generate a surplus margin of cash flow from its core activities in the year 2022 when it drastically touched 8443 Cr. Rs. It is a matter of concern that the company's operating activities cash flow has declined gradually post 2022 which depicts that the company has comparitively lesser cash to sustain its day-to-day activities. The company also needs to reconstruct its investment areas so as to ensure a positive value of cash flow from its investing activities which will help escalate the net change in cash value over the years. The financial balance of the company thus provides a declining picture of the company in the year 2023 as is observed from a negative value of net cash flow. The company shall have better future prospects if this trend is changed in the upcoming years.
The revenue figures as obtained from the table show handsome numbers and an increasing curve. The expenses of the company have gone higher every year but the company has challenged itself to achieve a net increase in its profit margin. The earnings per share of the company has also increased by a huge margin in the past 4 years which is a sign of marked increase in net worth of the company. The consistent value of its dividends per share has been maintained throughout. As the company has also been able to excel in maintaining its operational aspects, it has good chance of improving its financial stability in the future and establishing itself with a stronger hold in the market.
The data obtained from the balance sheet shows a straight upward curve in the total asset value of the company from 2019-2023. With the assets going up, the company seems to have avoided liquidity challenges or operational downfall. It depicts an escalation in the company's resources which might have affected its revenue generation margins. The company has paced up with the competitive market over the recent years and stands at 16258 Cr. Rs. in terms of equity. Having strong current assets is essential for a company to meet its short-term debt obligations and the company looks quite stable from that perspective too. Growth in equity over the years eye to the fact that the company has been able to curtail its operating expenses over the years which is important in the long run. The book value of the company is also on the upward curve which proves the financial stability of the company.
The data fetched from the table shows concerning numbers of the net change in cash as the company seems to have touched the -1746 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023. This highlights a dropdown in the company profits and is a risk in the path of sustainable growth. The opening cash balance of the company has been on the growth until 2021, post which it has seen a drastic dip, so it is needless to say that the company is doing low in terms of revenue generation compared to the previous year. The negative value of cash flow generated from operating activities depicts that the company has failed to accumulate cash from its prominent operations on a daily basis and is on the negative side. A lot of work is still needed on the investment front as the cash from investing activities is on the decline. This emphasises the need to reform its investment plans to maintain a higher net change in cash.
The income statement graph as is predicted from the given table in the picture shows a decline in revenues in the year 2021 when the numbers touched 7134 Cr. Rs. Ever since the company has been able to increase its revenue as well as its operating profit margin which is a sign of improved financial stability of the company. The net profit margin has also increased in the last few years which demonstrate that the company has been performing well in terms of net profit generation. The dividends per share value of the company shall attract investors in the long run and the company can be looked at with optimism in the upcoming years.
The information drawn from the given table represents the balance sheet of a company and shows the financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2019 to 2023, finally touching 2124 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues over the years with minor ups and downs and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands negligible which reduces the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting a positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run.
The overall analysis of the cash flow table of the company does not present a very impressive picture of the company in recent times. The company has been seen lagging in terms of maintaining a positive cash flow. The rate of losses from stock market has proved to have a detrimental effect on the company. The cash flow from operating activities has been fairly maintained over the years but has seen a sudden downfall in the last one year, so the company seems to be going hayward in terms of its day-to-day activities. It is a need of the hour that the company indulges itself in accumulating cash and works on improving its financial flexibility to overcome the liquidity challenge sit is currently facing.
The increase in revenues over the years for the company has been spectacular. The expenses have been on the rise but has been subtle enough. The net profit margin has been compensated with but need to be monitored in the long run to ensure that the company does not resort to a state of loss in the upcoming years. The company had significantly gone down in the year 2020 when it touched 4.79 Rs. but has seen significant increase as well. The company still continues to have the support of investors with its consistency in the dividends per share value. The expenses if curtailed, would be of a betterment to the company.
While the total assets of the company as seen a gradual upsurge over the years 2019-2023, the increase in liabilities of the company have gone hand in hand. This indicates that the company still has a long way to go to clear off owing cash to its creditors and this might have put some pressure on the company in recent times. The book value has increased in 2023 and has touched 74.96 Cr. Rs. However the common stock value as of 2023 stands at a consistent level of 107.73 Cr. Rs. which reflects investor expectations that the company will be profitable in the future.
The latest trends of cash flow data deciphered from the table indicate a subtle state of risk the company is in. It had been generating fairly good amount of revenues in the past year after consecutive years of very low opening cash balance. This might eye to a sudden increase in market base for the products or the services the company is rendering to its customers. However the net stocks value of the company has run down this year and is not suitable enough to neutralize the losses sufferred from investing sectors. Thus the net balance has declined to -29.68 Cr. Rs. and might take the company to a criticla stand point if the situation does not improve conspicuously in the next year.
We observe some interesting numbers from the given income statement table of the company. The earnings per share value of the company had gone down tremendously in the year 2021 when it touched -6.95 Rs. The expenses have been on the rise lately but had gone as low as 1915 in the year 2021. The company did not have enough market for its products and services and the net value of the company had also seen a certain decline in the last year which makes it difficult for investors to rely on the company as per the current scenario.
The trends in total assets posed by the company in the past five years gives a spectacular impression of the marked financial stability of the company. It depicts that the company has been able to keep up its revenue generation and has improved its net worth. While the company has also been hung on a good amount of liabilities, the amount of monetary dealings it owes to its creditors including accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued expenses have decreased over the years. The company stands at a lower risk to lenders and investors and a significant amount of its potential growth that is supported through borrowing has been compensated. As a result the debt to equity value stands at 0.05 Cr. Rs. as of 2023.
The data fetched form the given table throw light on the fact that the company had been struggling in terms of maintaining a steady upward curve for the net change in cash balance in 2021-2022 but has been able to overcome the same in the past one year. This might indicate lower rate of profits or over investment in the uncertain areas previously. As of 2023, the net change in cash has touched up to 719.95 Cr. Rs., the highest in the past five years and this is a point of marked improvement for all its shareholders. The company has been at a much better position in the year 2023 than what it had been in 2022, post which the effect of deinvestments had slightly improved and had begun to influence the progress of the company.
The statistics of the company as seen in the table throw light on the fact that the company had reached the bottom of its progress graph in the year 2021 when it was running at the severe loss of 5.23%. Over the years it has been able to compensate and look forward to an increase in the net profit margin as well as the net market value. Investors still have some doubts in mind because the dividends per share of the company is seen to have decreased in the year 2023 and has touched 13.5 Rs. The company is trying to challenge itself and regain its steady hold in the market.
An overall view of data obtained from the given balance sheet depicts that the company's assets have been showing variations over the years and thus the company has seen varying trends on resources to finance itself for future activities. There is also an overall current asset level maintained with time which the company might soon convert to cash. This is needed to support the company in case of short term debts and indicate liquidity improvement. With the book value of the company on the decline in the past year, the financial stability of the company is slightly shook and shows a questionable number.
The values obtained from the table shown are indicative of the fluctuations in the cash flow trends of the company in the past five years which is a measure of the financial strength and stability of the company. While the company has not been able to accumulate good margin of cash every year for an opening balance, it has been able to maintain an upward growth in terms of the investing cash flow. The cash flow from operating activities has reached a high of 628.82 Cr. Rs. which depicts that the core functionalities of the company are going on in full swing. There is a remarkable improvement in the investment front that the company has shifted from the negative cash flow to a positive range indicating that the strategic investments have been materialised. While the company has excelled in maintaining  a steady upward growth of cash flow generated from its investments, a little effort on the part of escalating its financial profit margin would set the net change to a more stable state.
Earnings per share of the company has recently gone down in the year 2023 which shows that the company has recently declined its net worth. The revenue of the company has also increased but the expenses have increased at a higher rate. The EBITDA values has seen a slight decrease which hints that the company might be struggling to maintain its operational efficiency. The dividends per share value of the company have also increased a little bit which can let the investors into some optimism about future prospects with the company.
With the variation in the equity values on the rise over the years 2019-2023, the company is seen to have maintained a high financial leverage to sustain itself for a prospective future. It also throws light on its effective business strategy that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. It is though appreciative to note that the company has been able to bring down its liabilities over the years thus indicating that it has been successful in meeting all the mandatory financial obligations it owed to its creditors which is a sign of marked financial stability. The book value of the company has also slightly increased in the last  year which hints at a possible change in the prevailing market conditions or an increased market value of its assets.
Summing up the observations from the table, we see that the company has been progressing with a varying margin of opening cash balance all throughout the years. It had tried to get over the uncleared debts and make a significant improvement in financial activities in 2021 but has touched down the -257.49 Cr. Rs. bottomline again. Thus the decline is more conspicuous in this case. It has been able to revamp its investment plans a little in the year 2022 as a result of which the cash flow from investing activities has become a little better in the following year, but it has a lot of efforts to be made in order to neutralise the net negative change in cash of -19.64 Cr. Rs. and strengthen its financial assets.
The data obtained from the given table shows mixed numbers and a fair, moderate scenario that the company is in. The revenue has increased over the years and has touched the mark of 2140 Cr. Rs. as of 2022, the highest in the past 5 years. The expenses have also increased hand in hand. The company needs to make more effort in maintaining a balance between the two parameters as the net profit margin of the company is seen to be on the decline. This number needs to be monitored to ensure that the company does not run into debt or has exccess overload to repay to its creditors. The earnings per share of the company has also gone down which indicates that the market of the company has decreased and the company may not experience the wholesome support of it shareholders and investors.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the total financial stability of the company over the years in terms of its net assets possessed. The notable rise in assets over the years indicate that the company has excelled in revenue generation and has a pretty positive hold on the current market. The increase in total liabilities have gone hand in hand and the company seems to have kept up well with the total accrued expenses. Investors shall have a devoted interest towards the company as is evident form its consistent stocks value. The company has also struggled to keep itself away from debt and bring down the equity value from 0.30 as of 2023.
A notable aspect about the data fetched from the table is the fact that the company has been able to increase the cashflow from its fibnancial activities in the year 2022 but has not been able to maintain the same. A lot of improvement is needed in the stock management aspect which sheds light on the proper management of assets and timely repurchase of stocks. This would facilitate the company to recover from a state of debt. The cash flow from investing activities has taken a slight improvment indicating the reduction in excess investments of the company or maybe the company has been making long term investments for a sustainable future.
The revenue of the company have been maintained in almost the same range. While the net profit margin of the company has slightly increased, it is a positive sign that the company is trying to elevate its profits by keeping a low on the expenses. The EBITDA values have also increased which show that the company has been doing perfectly fine in its day to day operations and can look forward to brighter days and gain the trust of it shareholders.
The data fetched from the balance sheet table is indicative of the financial numbers of the company which gives us an impression of the well-being of the company in the current market scenario. It provides a clear picture of a variation in the total assets owned by the company which depict that the company has undergone periodic gains in business and profitability. It is to be noted that the debt to equity ratio of the company has seen a consistent value over the years which is a positive sign. Thus we can say that the common stock values have been maintained at a fair range and the company is at a lower risk to lenders and investors because it suggests that the company is financing a significant amount of its potential growth by itself.
The revenue curve of the company as depicted from the cash flow table is a remarkable one. The company has been making a dip in its opening cash balance in 2020 but has upscaled efficiently in the year 2022 touching the 188.31 Cr. Rs. mark. The company seems to be performing well in terms of maintaining a balanced cash flow from its day to day activities in recent years but needs more improvement in making more strategic investment plans. The asset management plans of the company seem to have failed terribly as we see a gradual decrease in cash flow from its financial activities over the years. With negative figures of net change in cash in 2022-2023, the steep decline makes a huge difference on the current state of the company.
As the operational profit margin of the company has been maintained in the fairly same range along with its net profit margin, we can conclude from the given table that the company has been moderately in the same level in the past 5 years. The revenue has shown slight ups and downs which is negligible in terms of the huge market figures. While the dividend per share value has increased, it demonstrate that the company is making quite slow progress and trying to escalate revenues in the long run. Investors my look forward to prospects with this company with some conscious optimism.
The statistics obtained from the given balance statement table is indicative of the highs and lows of the company over the last 5 years which is evident from the mixed numbers of its total assets. The current and non current assets have thus seen a similar trend. They typically include long-term investments, property, plant, and equipment and is less liquid in nature. The liability curve suggests the companyâ€™s debt obligations have grown over the period and has dipped too. The non current liabilities of the company have seen a similar trend which points to the fact that the company may have taken on more long-term debts with every coming year to finance its operations and has possibly cleared them in time. Overall, the company is at a prominent stage in its development and has future scopes of expansion.
The opening cash balance of the company shows varying trends. It is seen that the company revenues have gone up and down gradually over the years which might point to an inconsistency in its revenues or market demand. This needs to be analysed in order to ensure better rates of net cash balance that the company holds for its sustainable growth at the end of the year. As per the current trends, the company has been prey to a number of excess expenditures and has not been performing impressively in managing its financial assets. As a result there has been improvement in the enhancement of negativ figures of net cash balance but the straight decrease in its overall balance in the year 2023 to -26.16 Cr. Rs. is still a mark of concern.
As of 2023, the revenues of the company has touched 6936 Cr. Rs., which is the highest in the past 5 years. This is clear from the table that the company has been working hard on improving its market strategies and increasing its customer base. The operating profit margin has gone down in recent years which highlights the need to improve on its operational aspects. The profit margin of the company has also gone down in recent years which might indicate that the company has been making more cost overheads in investing on its management and business development domain.
It is prominent from the table that the company has been able to maintain a steady upward graph in terms of its financial numbers over the years 2019-2022 after which it has seen some minor decline in revenues. Its increasing book value shows that the company has gained better financial credibility in the market in recent times. Shareholders have a good profit with the company as the rate of common stock value as reached to as high as 127.22 Cr. Rs. which is a marked sign of the company's increased net worth over the years. The debt to equity ratio over the years have seen an upsurge lately which is a sign of crisis. Lenders and Investors shall lean towards a company which has a lower debt-to-equity ratio.
The financial stability of the company is clearly measured from the data in the table which shows an overall negative net change in cash over the years but the figures have seen fluctuations. The company has bene provided with a handsome opening cash balance in 2022 but the numbers have gone down in recent years. It has also maintained a sustainability in its day-to-day businesses but the numbers have seen a gradual drop. The financial activities have resulted in poor turnover which might indicate inability to make payments to suppliers and inconsistent management of stocks. The investment profits are also negatively impacting the company's financial performance with slight betterment in the year 2023. A recovery phase from these downfalls would enable the company to mantain greater cash in hand and sustain itself better in the long run.
It is a conspicuous change that we see in the numbers obtained from the table. The earnings per share of the company had drastically gone down in the year 2021 touching - 6.17 Rs. As a result the net profit margin had reached a very low end of - 76.08%. The revenue generation policy had clearly failed in the year 2021 as the expenses where almost double the mark. In recent years the company has not seen very significant progress but has made some gradual improvement in increasing its net profit margin to 18.86% It has a lot of effort to be made in the upcoming years in order to establish a sustainable hold in the market.
The bigger picture of the company's highs and lows can be clearly depicted from the given balance sheet statement. The company has been sustaining itself well in the past five years and has made a fair increase in the total asset values. The trend in liabilities has seen ups and downs over the years which might indicate fluctating market scenarios and the increased need for the company to depend on its investors for monetary and operational supplies. The book value of the company has touched as high as 53.96 Cr. Rs. as of 2023 which raises positive ideas on the market value of its assets and needs to be monitored.
It is clear from the given table that the company is doing moderately well in terms of maintaining a steady cash flow from operating activities in 2023 after consecutive years of downfall. It requires significant enhancement in strategies in order to streamline cash flows generated from investing activities. The net change in cash flow has dropped in the year 2021 to a negative value which might indicate the impact of excess losses or the state of debt the company is in. It is also to be noted that the opening cash flow of the company has been maxmum in the year 2023 where it touched 70.42 Cr. Rs. Overall, the company needs to be monitored slightly so as to enhance the deinvestment values and escalate the net change in cash.
The data obtained from the table shows mixed numbers.. The earnings per share of the company has seen a certain downfall in the year 2022 when it touched 265.47 Rs. from 4106 Rs. as that of 2021. The revenue curve has also been fluctuating which shows that there is less consistency in the revenue generation strategies and overall market that the company deals in. The expenses of the company have also been overall in the same range without much fluctuation. The company has been able to increase its revenues slightly along with the net profit margin. The overall market value of the company has decreased and this may have an impact on the shareholders of the company.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2018-2019. The total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. However it is a key point that the book value of the company has gone done by a great margin in the year 2022 from 967.65 Cr. Rs. to 554.70 Cr. Rs. This needs to be analysed as it might hint to a fluctuating market scenario or likewise. Stock rates of this company have been maintained at the same level essentially which is a parameter that might attract shareholders in the long run.
The opening balance of the company shows an upward variation over the years which seems like the company has been able to maintain a profitable rate of revenues. Revenues had significantly gone up in 2022 and the operating activities of the company failed to generate enough cashflow. The companies investments have impacted the net balance and as a result the company has witnessed an overall positive net cash balance in the past years. The company has been running into debt in the past year and might have a lot of withstanding expenditure. The company is struggling to improve its performance and the year 2023 has seen the net cash balance touching -533.10 Cr. Rs., thus it still has a long way to go in order to establish a strong financial status.
The statistics we see from the given income statement stable indicates that there has been an absurd increase in the revenue count of the company in the last 5 years. The highest revenue touched has been 14555 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. Expenses have gone in upward direction as well which has led to and overall decrease in the net profit margin of the company. The current net profit margin stands at 9.81% which means that the company has not been able to balance its growing expenses and revenue generation strategies. As the earnings per share continue to be at the consistent level, it is to be noted that the value has drastically decreased than what it was in the year 2020. Thus we see a sudden mark of decline in the figures of the company which is a matter of concern.
The company has been maintaining a steady gain of revenues over the years 2019-2023 as is evident from the increasing values of total assets over the years. The total asset value as of 2023 stands at a striking 11189 Cr. Rs. mark which is an excellent transition. The company might have recently revamped its strategic plans or modified its revenue generation skills to have reached out to a wider market base in the past year. The values of liquid assets have also seen a constant rise with an increase in the current liabilities of the company. They are the claims of outsiders on the company's assets and need to be reduced as soon as possible. Stocks have risen with the trending market and this gives scope for the company to attract investors and shareholders for a better financial strength in the future.
The year 2023 had witnessed a poor inflow from investing activities of the company as is shown from the data given. This highlights the fact that the organisation has not been operating profitably and is short of cash to repay its creditors. With the coming years, there have been transitions at the operational level and the company has been able to make better gains but it is still making deinvestments. The cash flow from investing activities need to be looked into as this is seen to affect the net cash flow of the company. The company seems to be doing fine in terms of its financial activities and is not in a state of debt or involved in stock buybacks as a result of which its cash flow from financing activities has gone up in the past 2 years. A prominent aspect to be noted here is the vast difference in the net change in cash balance as compared to the year 2021 which throws some urgency for a positive transition of the company in the recent years.
It is evident from the given figures that the company has been doing good in terms of revenue generation over the years. The net profit margin of the company has slightly decreased in the year 2023 as is evident from the net profit margin of 9.81% The expenses of the company has been continuously on the rise which is impactful enough on the financial standards of the company. The dividends per share value has consequently decreased in comparison to what it was in the year 2021 which throws doubts on the fact that the investor rate might be hampered.
It is significant from the data of the following table that the company has been able to increase its revenue generation strategies over the years and has expanded its assets on a large scale. A marked increase in total asset account the company has successfully touched the 37712 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023. Liability of the company stands at a fairly high level followed by some current liabilities. The company has a higher margin of non current liabilities which eye to long term Investment plans for the company. It does not affect the liquid cash inflow. As we see an upward growth in the total equity of the company, it represents a positive approach towards the financial prospects of the company. The company has also been able to maintain a consistent amount of shares which makes it gain the confidence of shareholders who will also be attracted by the higher book value touched in the last year. It is a matter of fact that the overall trend in book value shows a downfall but the company gives hopes of improvement in the near future.
It is evident from the table that the investing activities of the company have witnessed a massive decline in numbers over the years which is a sign that the investments of the company have generated lesser returns than expected, thus leading the company to a state of loss. The company has seen the same trend in dealing with its financial activities too, with slight improvement in the year 2022 where it reached a figure of -610.94 Cr. Rs. The overall performance of the company has not been at par with the success curve as the company has been witnessing a negative net cash flow in the year 2023, the lowest value reaching -1023 Cr. Rs. It is indicative that the company needs to focus on inflow of cash from a its long-term investments to balance the amount of cash equivalents leaving and entering a company.
The data as seen from the income statement table of the given company shows a straight decline in numbers in the financial parameters of the company in the past 5 years. The revenue of the company had drastically gone down in the year 2021 when it touched 81.13 Cr. Rs.. The expenses had also decreased at the same margin which might indicate that the company had seen and overall reduction in its market value. The EBITDA values continued to show similar sign and thus we conclude that the company had decreased its operational efficiency. The operating profit margin has also seen a negative value across the period of 5 years which clearly shows that the company is in debt. All though it has the support of shareholders it has been running into a state of loss and might have a detrimental impact if the trend prevails.
It is remarkable from the given balance sheet of the company that there has been a significant fluctuation in the total revenue generation of the company in the year 2019 to 2023. The company has, as a result, witnessed a decline in the total asset value in the year 2021. It has been able to totally compensate for the loss in the recent years. Current assets of the company are fairly high which points to the fact that the company has worked on maintaining a short term in hand cash flow in order to support its operating activities. The total liabilities of the company have also gone down with time which is a good sign and the amount of current liabilities that the company holds have also decreased in recent times. There has been significant decline in the total equity possessed by the company in 2021 which is a concern for the company in the long run. It has been able to maintain the stock on a consistent range and can still gain the confidence and support of investors as it has touched a higher book value as per the recent trends.
The data fetched from the table is indicative of the point that the company had declined by a steep margin in the year 2021 due to greater amout of deinvestments. Hand in hand, it had not been able to gather enough cash from financing or via issuing stocks which further added to the negative values. In recent years, the trend in cash flow from operating activities is seen to have a positive growth. It clearly indicates that the company is able to sustain enough cash for its daily activities and can lead to the betterment of the company. The overall cash balance as of 2023 stands at -128.53 Cr. Rs. which is not a profitable lumpsum comparitive to the previous years and shows the financial strength of the company to have declined. This data needs to be monitored in the upcoming years too.
As seen from the given income statement table, the revenue of the company has seen slow growth over the years until 2023. Expenses have gone hand in hand and the net profit margin has touched 6.05% Investors might be facing a tough time as the overall market value of the company seems to have gone down. It is the need of the hour that the company looks into its market strategies and revises it operation and goals so that the overall operational efficiency can be improved and thus the company can look forward to a brighter future.
The given table is a representation of the balance sheet of a company from 2019 to 2023. The company has seen a straight increase in its total equity till 2022 which throws light on the stability and financial performance of the company. Overall the table gives a mixed outlook about the company as we see an increase in its net market profit. The common stock values are increasing at slow but gradual rate. The book value of the company has also seen a consequent decline in the current times which means that the company has not been able to maintain a balance between its total assets and liabilities generated. As the total assets have been slightly on the decline in the past year, the total liabilities have seen a fluctuating trend too. The company still holds some amount of current liabilities which can be converted into cash in the next one year and can help the company build a better base for the future.
The opening cash balance of the company does not hold up a very profitable picture of the company as the revenue generation seems to have gone low in the years 2021 and 2023. This drastic decline has somehow been balanced by the cash flow from other sources, resulting in an overall net positive balance of the company. A matter of concern is the declining values of cash flow from investing activities which is indicative of the fact that the company has not been maintaining day to day investment profits in business or the net capital of the company is on the decline. This is crucial to sustain the company and its resources. In the year 2021, there has been drastic deinvestments and the company needs to adhere to the fact that it should carefully target potential opportunities in its current business. The fact that the company is doing better than the year 2022 in terms of maintaining an average range of net profit is a ray of hope that the company might upscale this margin in the long run.
The trend in revenue curve of the company shows positive variation. The expenses of the company have increased with time and has touched to 1.36 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. The net profit margin has slightly gone down in recent years but holding optimistic prospects this variation in number might rise. The earnings per share of the company have also gone down in the year 2023 which depics that the company has witnessed an overall reduction in its net market value. It is possible that the company might still have the support of its investors who look forward to future prospects with this company holding some positivity.
The statistics obtained from the balance sheet of the given company reveals certain figures about the overall financial stability of the company in the years 2019 to 2023. There has been a gradual increase in the total assets posed by the company. Current assets of the company show similar trends and have dipped in 2023 which reveals that the company has a fairly lesser amount of cash in hand in order to support its operating activities. The non concurrent assets of the company through light on the long term investment plans that it might have. As the liabilities continue to go on the rise the company still has some work to be done in order to repay what it owes to its creditors. An increasing variation has been observed in the total equity value which hints at the fact that the years have seen a significant incline in prosperity in the market revenue or market scenario. The company still has a good hold on its stock values and shows no signs of debt which puts the company in a fairly stable position.
The recent trends in the net cash balance of the company signify passive numbers as the negative values indicate a state of loss. The company might be in a current state of debt and has touched the cash flow from financial activity mark of -154.80 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company had been facing a tough time in the year 2022 where it suffered a loss in cash of -145.53 Cr. Rs. from its investing activities, following which it seems to have made some reformations and improved the situation. It still has a long way to go in making a positive figure and add to the net balance of the company. Th ecompany is currently in a state of debt or is undergoing share buybacks for long term investments which has resulted in the rapid decline of the cash flow rates lately.
The year 2019 has seen a gradual dip in the revenue growth of the company in the past 5 years. Expenses in the following year had gone down correspondingly. The net profit margin saw a similar trend in the year 2019 at 33.01%. The trends in the profit margin over the period of 5 years shows gradual and steady increase until 2023. Currently the company stands at 44.55% net profit and this is a point of positivity for the future prospects of the company. A consistent range of earnings per share can gain the confidence of shareholders over time. While the company has been performing exceptionally well in the last two years touching a wholesome revenue of 1129 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023, some work is still to be done in the sphere of escalating the overall profit margin for the company on which the company stands.
The given picture is a table of a balance sheet of a company which helps us to analyse the ups and downs in generation of assets of a company over a period of time. It is clearly depicted from the table that the company has seen a major upward growth in its total asset value over the years with the highest value touching 7176 Cr. Rs. in 2023. The company holds good amount of liabilities which need to be cleared of. Current assets of the company has been fairly maintained at high rate but has seen variating figures over time. The company has incurred good amount of monetary support to sustain its day to day operations. The total equity of the company had gradually gone up in the year 2023 when it reached 3339 Cr. Rs. Thus the company is quite profitable in the market but overall the book value has seen a decline over the years which needs to be monitored.
The trend in cash flow from investing activities as per the table denotes the amount of deinvestments that the company has gone through in the year 2020. It probably has  made surplus expenditures in purchases of physical assets or invested in sales and securities. However, it has been exceptionally able to maintain a steady upward curve in terms of cashflow from its financial activities which has been a boon to maintaining a positive net balance in the initial years. As of 2023, the net increased balance stands at 41.59 Cr. Rs., which has been higher than the last negative values and needs to be worked on.
The financial reports shown in the table throw light on the 5 year progress of the company in terms of its financial parameters. The revenue generation of the company increased in the first year while it witnessed a sudden setback in the year 2020, following which the company has seen moderate growth and is currently in a stable position. The expenses of the company have been at par with the revenue and the operational efficiency of the company currently is also commendable. From the net profit margin data we see some fluctuations in values. While the company faced a decline in terms of net profit margin over the period of 2020 and 2022, it is notable that the company has made significant improvement in terms of net profit margin in the year 2021. However 2022 is witnessing a downfall of the company in terms of its net profit. Shareholders can look forward to lesser profits in comparison to previous years and the same goes at par with the investors. It is necessary that the company makes amendments to balance the net profit margin in order to re-establish itself as a strong company in the market.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain an increase in its total equity over the years. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. Current assets of the company has also touched a huge mark of 3922 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company has enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. It has always been on the increase except in 2019 when it witnessed a sudden decline in current assets. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has been consistent throughout, the book value has seen slow growth which is also a positive sign for the company in the long run. The book value as of 2023 has decreased slightly and investors might look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
Summing up the observations from the table, we see that the company has been progressing with a more or less same range of opening cash balance in recent years after a steep downfall in 2020. It had tried to get over the uncleared debts and make a moderate improvement in financial activities in 2020 but has touched down the -487.70 Cr. Rs. bottomline again. Thus the decline is more conspicuous in this case. It has been able to revamp its investment plans a little in the year 2020 but it has a lot of efforts to be made in order to neutralise the net negative change in cash and strengthen its financial assets.
The data provided in the table shows interesting numbers which depict the financial performance of the company in the span of 2020-2023. While the company's net profit margin increased from 2022-2023, it saw a major decline in profit in the year 2021 when the profit margin touched 2.31%. The company has been trying to compensate this loss in net profit margin and looking forward to reach higher value in the upcoming years. The revenue graph shows increasing variation from the year 2020 onwards. While expenses have been rising on the go, the company has also been capable of maintaining its operational efficiency as is evident from the EBITDA values. Overall the company has been able to maintain good operating profit margin up to the year 2023 but there is a significant decrease in the year 2021 which might indicate a lack of proper operational strategies and planning in that year. The company has secured in maintaining its market value at an increasingly consistent rate and shareholders can enjoy a benefit of 19.61 Rs. earnings per share. The company is in its progressing stage and is at a fairy positive position in the market.
From the given table it is a matter to concentrate on the fact that the company has been making significant progress over the years in terms of total revenue generation, which is evident from the figures of its total assets. The year 2023 has seen an increase in the total asset value by a huge margin when it touched 1419 Cr. Rs. The non current liabilities is a depiction that the company has recently increased its long term investment and thus it relies on external resources for funding. Liabilities of the company has increased with time which needs to be monitored and cut down at the earliest. The company also has a small amount of non current liability in its name which has decreased a little in 2023. This might include long term debt which in the future can put the company at a financial risk. The debt to equity of the company seems to have decreased a little bit with time which is a positive sign as the company is not as highly dependent on its creditors as it was in the past year. Thus the company has been maintaining a good asset margin. It would be good for it to look into maintaining this rise in book value figures and the increasing liabilities to reach a better position in the market.
The values obtained from the picture displayed depict the four year performance of a company in terms of its financial records. The cash flow values from operating activities reflect that the company has not been performing up to the mark in terms of its core operations which is essential for sustaining the day to day activities of the company. This gradual decline in cash flow from investing activities is the main reason of decrease in the net change in cash over the years. While the cash flow from investing activities has also been on the negative side, it is evident that the company has involved itself in excess capital expenditures and hence its current expenses need to be cut off. The company has shown exceptional performance in maintaining a positive increase in cash flow obtained from financial activities. The net change in cash overall has been on the increase which needs to be further enhanced for the future growth of the company.
The company data highlights a major point in the progress curve of the company. The company had undergone a huge margin of loss in its net profit in the year 2020, where its net profit margin reduced to 2.33%. The company might have been going through a tough time in that year and struggling to keep up with the tremendously increasing expenses. Over the years the revenue growth has increased by a good margin every year and so has the expenses. It is an impressive fact to observe that the year 2023 has an account of more net profit margin on the part of the company. This aims at the companies improvement in terms of maintaining a sustainable proportion of numbers. While the EBITDA values of the company show ups and downs, the company still has been able to win an optimum value of operating profit margin as of the Year 2023. Recovering from the state of loss incurred by the company in 2020, the company is at a much better position today.
With time the company has demonstrated varying trends in the different parameters as observed from the given balance sheet table. It is to be noted that the overall assets of the company have been constantly on the rise which is a good sign for the stability of the company. It has certain non current assets which the company might have reserved for long term investments. Thus the company has enough money to sustain itself at the operational level as well as in the near future. However it has been witnessing a liability charge over the years which needs to be brought down at the earliest. The common stock values are maintained overall in the same level and the company might be an attraction for investors at the moment because of its high book value of 43.58 Cr. Rs.  which it reached in the year 2023. The debt to equity value of the company has also seen a light decrease in the year 2023 indicating that the company has lesser debt to be cleared in the last year.
From the table given above we see a comparison in the cash flow parameters of a company over the years 2019-2023. The opening cash balance of the company has gone down in the year 2021 followed by an increase in cash flow from operating activities. This is a proof that the company has been able to make good profit from its core functions which is essential for maintaining an equilibrium in day-to-day financial activities. The investing activities have not generated much cash in the years which lays emphasis on the fact that the company might have made too many divestments or significant capital expenditures. The negative values of cash flow through financial activities also mean that the company might be under debt for a short period of time. Overall the net change in cash balance has improved but still needs to be maintained so that the company can turn out to be profitable in the market in the long run.
The year 2022 had witnessed a tremendous downfall in the net profit margin of the company which had touched 7.24% as against 11.00% of 2021. It is notable that the company revenues had dropped in the year 2020 which throws light on the overall market condition that year. The operational profit margin has shown a consequent fall in the year 2022 and has been rising henceforth at a remarkable rate. Though the company struggled in the year 2022 to maintain a sustainable profit margin, it has slowly backed up again in the year 2023 and this is a point to be highlighted in order to comment on the current status of the company. However the company has a long way to go in order to establish itself in the market scenario and expand its hold. It is also a matter of importance that the company has increased its EPS values in the year 2023 and should be able to enjoy the benefit of investors likewise.
The data obtained from the given bank statement sheet is a testament of the fact that the company has seen ups and downs in terms of revenue generation and has expanded itself to acquire more and more assets over the years. The highest asset value of the company as that of 2023 stands at 2062 Cr. Rs. The total liabilities of the company have also gone hand in hand and the company has to make a lot of progress in order to cut those down. The total equity of the company seems to have touched a higher margin which throws light on the financial stability of the company with time. Shareholders have found a good profit in this company with its consistent values of stock and book value. The debt to equity stands comparitively low which is indeed a good sign for the company as it indicates that the company has been at a  lesser debt over the last year and can  effectively make a firm hold in the rapidly developing market.
The table given depicts the highs and lows in the cash flow values of a company over a span of five years. The cash flow from operating activities had gone down drastically in 2020 post which it has been able to reach a steady margin of 402.16 Cr. Rs. It is interesting to know that the cash flow from investing activities has seen transitions with the deepest point at -129.12 Cr. Rs. As of 2023, the company has made a strictly declining cash flow from financial activities which stands at -250.68 Cr. Rs. The company might have been suffering from debt repayment or stock buybacks. Consequently the net cash inflow for the company has also seen a positive value in 2023 as opposed to the degrading number in the previous year which gives some confidence on the company's short term investments.
The company data from the table shows a revenue growth curve. As per the latest revenue record, the company has been successful in achieving the mark of 7307 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The operating profit margin of the company faced decline until 2023. The year 2023 has witnessed the earnings per share of the company touch the -1.57 Rs. mark which is not at all a lucrative deal for shareholders. While shareholders have found a deprecating deal with this company, it needs to be monitored for future variations in numbers. Overall net profit margin has been steeply declining and shows fluctuations. It is imperative that the company balances its revenues and its expenses in order to maintain a consistency in growth.
The given table gives us a clear picture of the bank statement of a company in the years 2021 to 2023. The total equity of the company has seen a gradual rise in curve which gives us a positive outlook of the financial well being of the company with time. As of 2023, it stands at an increasing point in terms of debt to equity which means that the company has to make significant efforts to clear off its debts. The book value has been on a consistent range which removes the fear of liquidity challenges and helps the company gain the trust of investors and shareholders likewise. The total assets and liabilities of the company show a consequent rise which is a sign that though the company has been able to generate sufficient funds over the years, it still has a good amount of cash owed to its creditors as well. Overall, the company is in a stable position to establish stronger market base in the future and grow it rapidly.
The numbers obtained from the given table throw light on the varying trends in cash flow values of a company over the past 3 years between 2021 to 2023. It has been a commendable job on the part of the company to maintain a positive cash flow from operating activities throughout the years but the values have seen a subtle decline in 2023. It highlights the amount of cash generated from the company's core operations. The cash flow from investing activities has touched the negative mark and is on the betterment phase with every passing year. It is essential that the company reconsiders its investment strategies or pushes itself to curtail excess investment for a particular time. The amount of cash generated by the company from stocks and other resources had gone down in the year 2022 when it touched 794.19 Cr. Rs. However the current value as of 2023 stands at 817.79 Cr. Rs. which is an improved number. Therefore we can conclude from the observations that though the company has seen major setback in the year 2022, the company has tried to recover from the state of loss in the year 2023 supported by a net change in cash flow of -31.95 Cr. Rs. It still needs to make effortsto neutralise the negative number and make progress.
The data obtained from the table reflects a mixed variation over the three years in terms of financial stability of the company. The revenue data shows ups  with variations that are not very drastic, overall within the same range. It is notable that the operating profit margin of the company has been maintained at an average range with gradual lows. Initially the company might have spent less budget on escalating its operational efficiency and has successfully reached the mark in the year 2023 as is prominent from te high EBITDA value. It is at a sweet spot for shareholders who will be attracted by  the high earnings per share values as of the recent years. Thus the company is at a stable position to channelise its growth in the upward direction with the sheer support of its investors and has future prospects to attain greater targets.
Increase in book value up to 87646 Cr. Rs. in the year 2022 has been a turning point in the progress of the company, and makes the company represent an optimistic view towards its financal progress. However the value has gone down steeply in the year 2023. Total liabilities of the company have decreased and the company has lesser cash to payback to its creditors. The total equity of the company being on the increasing slope, shareholders might look forward to future prospects with this company. The debt to equity value of the company needs to be monitored in the upcoming years as it has shown slight increase which means that the company has more of debt finances to repay.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 5 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing remarkably low in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years 2020-2021 which hints at the fact that the company had not been investing on its strategies and management plans. The operating profit margin is on the rise, but it has not been able to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin too. In the year 2023, net profit margin touched -103.48%, and thus the company continues to be in a state of loss. The company needs to aim at enhancing the numbers strategically. As a result, it has been able to touch the 1123 Cr. Rs. revenue mark as of 2023. Overall the company is not progressing at a steady phase and will definitely be in debt  if enhancements are not made.
The table given is a depiction of the balance sheet of a company from 2019 to 2023. It is clear from the given data that the company has been struggling to sustain itself throughout the past 5 years by making a good asset income. It has failed to expanded its assets and has resulted in a negative value of equity. The debt to equity value of the company is neutral but the book value has seen a fatal blow which is a matter of sheer concern. Investors shall not have a good attraction towards this company as it has touched a tremendously low book value of -127.82 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. Overall the company has been performing at a loss and it would be good if the total liability value is under check. This will ensure that the company does not run into a state of risk in the near future.
The picture gives us the financial values of cash flow data for a particular company during the year 2019 to 2023. The opening cash balance of the company as maintained every year shows recent declining values. The company is making enough cash flow from its daily operations in the past 3 years which is essential for sustaining the day-to-day activities. It is to be noted that the cash flow from financial activities have seen a steep decline from 2020 onwards and has fallen by a drastic margin in the past year when it touched -494.37 Cr. Rs. The negative values signal that excess cash has been invested into financing sources which might include from issued stocks or from borrowing. Hence the company is not at a profitable position. Financial standards of the company can be further upgraded if the company pushes brakes on investments that do not bear an equilibrium return. This will prevent the cash flow from touching the negative mark. On an average the company has not been able to maintain a net positive change in cash value over the past 4 years with a drastic dip in the year 2020 and is slowly trying to work on the same.
The statistical report of the company obtained from the table over the span of past 5 years make it clear that the company had performed poor in the year 2020 when it touched a net profit margin of 5.41%.

The company has been successful in escalating its operational efficiency in the following years. Overall the trends in the net profit margin of the company do pose a much reliable picture. Shareholders might also get attracte to its increasing earnings per share rates. Thus, the company is performing fine in recent times with respect to profit margin and efficiency. It should maintain its upward curve at this pace to maintain a sustainable hold in the market.

The revenues of the company has slightly dipped in the year 2020 when it touched a total asset value of 1660 Cr. Rs. There might have been challenges in maintaining a high market value or the overall market condition might have gone critical during that time. The company has good amount of non current assets which depicts that the company has invested a lot in long term prospects. The year 2023 has seen an upsurge in the current asset value which is a sign of stability that the company has been able to sustain its operation activity at a much more productive level. The total equity of the company has seen an increase over the years which is coupled with the increase in book value of the company in comparison to the last year. However the debt to equity value of the company needs to be monitored for better balance in the future.

Just at the same instance, the cash flow from investing activities had also touched -319.85 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well.

The cash flow had increased by a positive margin in the year 2023. Though the company has been able to maintain a positive net change in cash in 2023, the data needs to be monitored in the long run.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 5 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing remarkably well in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years which hints at the fact that the company has been judiciously investing on its strategies and management plans. Though the operating profit margin is on the rise, it has not been able to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin too. In the year 2023, net profit margin faced a severe low of 17.12% . As a result, it is currently declining and needs to be making gradual improvements at the same pace to ensure the stability of the company and to gain a good trust of its prospective investors.
The given table gives us a clear picture of the balance sheet of a company in the years 2019 to 2023. The total equity of the company has seen a gradual rise in curve which gives us a positive outlook of the financial well being of the company with time. As of 2023, it stands at a very negligible point in terms of debt to equity which means that the company has made significant progress in upholding its financial standards. The book value had been on the decline in 2022 which instills the fear of liquidity challenges and might challenge the company to gain the trust of investors and shareholders likewise. The total assets and liabilities of the company show a consequent rise which is a sign that though the company has been able to generate sufficient funds over the years, it still has a good amount of cash owed to its creditors as well. Overall, the company is in a positive state and needs to establish stronger market base in the future to grow rapidly.
The table shown displays cash flow trends of a company over the span of 2019-2023. The change in net cash is spontaneous. The company had always been running low in terms of making cash flow from investing activities which has further seen a steep decline in the year 2022 where it touched -553.79 Cr. Rs. This has resulted in huge deviations. The company might have invested more during the period but has not been able to gather enough returns from the same. The segment of cash flow from operating activities has seen ups over the years, but has grown by a higher margin in 2023 where it steadily reached 260.30 Cr. Rs. This lays emphasis on the fact that the company has been successful in generating enough cash from its core operations in the past year which will allow it to sustain its day-to-day activities. Overall, the company's net cashflow curve shows a steadily increasing trend which is a sign of stability for the company in the long run.
The revenue curve for the company data displayed is a U-shaped curved between 2019-2023. The expenses show a similar trend in values. The company had faced a tremendous fall in the year 2022 when its net profit margin dropped to 2.04% as opposed to the previous year values of 13.39%. Over the years from 2023, it has been able to pull up its socks and make a steady growth in its net profit margin. It has been showing commendable results in balancing its operating profit margin in 2023 irrespective of the rising expenses. With earnings per share increasing by a huge margin in the year 2023, shareholders will be highly moved by the variation and shall make better profits. It will be worthwhile if the company is able to sustain this growth curve in the near future in order to have a stable hold in the market.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain a slow but gradual increase in its total equity over the years except for a drop in the year 2020. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. Current assets of the company has also touched a huge mark of 1885 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company has enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. It has always been on the increase except in 2020 when it witnessed a sudden decline in total assets. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation in the year 2020 or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has been consistent throughout, the book value has seen slow growth which is also a positive sign for the company in the long run. Investors might look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
A close look at the cash flow statistics obtained from the table throws light on the fact that the company has seen a varying trend in the opening amount of its cashflow balance over the years. The cash flow from its operating activities have seen tremendous decrease over the years until 2021 when it reached its lowest point at -40.41 Cr. Rs. In the following years, the company has struggled to elevate the numbers but has seen itself at an even lower point in the year 2023. This proves that the company has encountered significant capital expenditures and needs to push brakes on external investments. The company is performing fairly well in maintaining a consistent rate of cash inflow from its financial activities which will help the company to maintain a profitable balance in the future. The year 2022 had witnessed a good margin of cash raised from operations sector post which the company seems to have gone into deinvestmnets. Thus, the overall scenario does not provide a very stable picture as the net cash flow is still on the decline and a sustainable position of the company cannot be ensured.
The table depicts the financial reports of a company in the last five years between 2019-2023. It is prominent that the company is showing mixed progress over the years and has been able to maintain an average value for its financial numbers. The company has made moderate revenues over the years with a sudden fall in the year 2023. Thus, the net profit margin of the company is also going low over the years by conspicuous numbers which is not a sign of prosperity for the company. It has also been the last choice for shareholders with its earnings per share touching 23.16 Rs. in 2023. Investors can look forward to future prospects with this company after the dividends per share values are on the rise.
With the growing years the balance sheet of the company in the given picture shows that the total assets of the company has increased at a phenomenal rate. The current assets of the company have also grown fairly which shows that the company shall not have to suffer monetory challenges in maintaining its daily operational efficiency. The total liabilities of the company have also increased every year and the company needs to keep a check on compensating these liabilities on priority. However with the book value of the company touching high of 336.60 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023, coupled with a consistent value of stocks, investors will be attracted towards making future prospects in this company.
The statistics obtained from the data shown proves that the company has faced marked decline in terms of net cashflow in the year 2020 when it touched -153.85 Cr. Rs. This definitely puts a question on the financial flexibility of the company but has improved in recent times. While the company has been able to maintain a fair amount of increasing opening balance every year, the total cash flow from external activities does not stand at par with it. The trends in the cash flow from operating activities shows positive numbers throughout. The company has been the witness of significant divestments in the past five years and it is noteworthy that the value is declining by a steeper margin as of 2022. Over the years the debt has increased too which has impacted the overall financial position of the company in the market. The net cash balance of the company has seen a marked improvement in the year 2023 which is a positive sign that the company is working on its overall financial stability.
The data obtained from the table clearly reveals that the company has been struggling over the years to make a stable proifit margin. With running at a low in the year 2023 at 11.25%, it tried hard to make slight variation in the profit values. The decline in profit in the last 2 years has been gradual, but it is noteworthy that the company needs to recover itself from the state of loss. It has also been able to maintain a steady range of net operational margin untill 2022. Shareholders can hold some hope as the earnings per share of the company seem to have risen in the past 2 years as compared to the range it was initially in.
The given data fetched from the companies balance sheet report gives and insight into the financial status of the company and its asset management strategies over the years 2019 to 2023. The current assets of the company has also been on the rise. There is no fear of a sudden loss or shortage of finances for the daily run of the company. However it is considerable to know that the total liabilities have increased over the years with lesser rate of non current liabilities. It does not have very long term investment plans in mind but needs to work on mitigating the current liabilities and bringing them down to a stand still. The appreciative part is the net rise in the total equity values which stands at 4370 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. The data is thus indicative of a positive upward growth of the company and shows prospects of gaining more stability in the coming future.
The numbers from the table show some interesting aspects about the company. The year 2021 had witnessed a steep downfall in the net cash value as the company had made itself prone to a number of deinvestments. The number has improved in the next years and the company has been working on maintaining high standards of its operational efficiency as well as its financial activities. The company can look forward with some optimism if this trend is maintained in the upcoming years too.
It is clearly visible from the table that the financial reports of the company have not proved to be lucrative enough for its investors and will not attract shareholders likewise. The company has been maintaining steady growth in revenues over the years but has been a victim of an imbalance in the higher rate of increasing overhead costs and expenditires. As a result what follows is sheer loss and the company net profit margin has been on the decline. Though the compaany has performed a little better in the year 2021 comparitively, its net profit still stands at a low of 13.97% which is prominently not the sign of a sustainable company with future prospects. The same trend is not observed in its operational and functional efficiency as a result of which it is imperative to conclude that the company is on the path of moderate growth.
The statistic reports obtained from the given table of the company reflects a certain upsurge in the total assets of the company in the year 2023 when the values touched 11795 Cr. Rs. The current assets of the company depict that the company is cutting down its investment on its daily activities. The rate of increase of total liabilities has been steady up to 2022 following which it has gone higher by a deep margin. There is still a lot of progress to be made in this aspect as the net liability should not be an obstacle in the path of maintaining financial stability. The company's total equity values have increased over the years steadily, followed by a consistent range of common stock. Thus the debt to equity values of the company has also seen a significant rise upto 172.95 Cr. Rs. which eyes to degradation of the prosperity for the company in the long run.
From the given table we can clearly analyse the statistics of the company from the year 2019 to 2023. The data obtained from the table portrays a clear picture of the company's cash flow statements highlighting the drop in cash flow from operating activities in the past year by a huge margin. The company has touched -2994 Cr. Rs. from operating activities which is definitely not a positive sign for a sustainable development in the future. The net change in cash observed over the years has seen a drastic increase in the year 2023, which shows that the company had been in a stable position and had been making good enough profits. The net change in cash values have gone down in 2020 when the company had reached its lowest point. Overall the company has been performing great in terms of strategic investments as most of its data depict profitable capital expenditures. It has been able to maintain a consistency in cash flow from financial activities too which is a positive sign that the company is not in debt.
A striking point to be observed from the given table is the increase in the company's net profit margin in the year 2020. Profit margin increased to 6.75%  and shows signs of advancement of the company. The revenues are at par with the growth of the company and it is evident that in recent years the company has been performing better than before. Efficiency in operational aspects have also taken a sudden setback in 2023 and is indicative of lesser future prospects of the company to strengthen its working proficiency. Currently the company is not at a lucrative state for shareholders and investors  and shows need of betterment in the future.
The given balance sheet of the company is indicative of the fact that the total assets of the company has significantly increased over the years until 2023 when it touched the 5959 Cr. Rs. mark. It has slightly toned down its liabilities in 2022 and has been able to maintain an overall positive financial supply for smooth functioning of its day to day operational activities. Total liabilities of the company has increased over the years and has reached the highest mark of 2291 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. Significantly the total equity values have faced an upward growth. The company has thus been able to maintain an upward growth of its market shares and needs to maintain the same trend in book values which will fetch more investors.
The statistics obtained from the table depict the cash flow picture of a company in the past 5 years. The company has seen drastic decrease in its operating cash balance in the year 2022 which points to the fact that the company had not been in its stable state by a huge margin. Over the years it has tried to escalate its revenues and touch an opening cash balance of 2060 Cr. Rs. as of 2022. The company had not been making a profit margin from its operational activities in 2022 and had dropped low drastically. Thus the company has not been persistently involved in generating cash flow from its core operations which might make it difficult for the company to sustain itself. The same trend is noticed in its financing activities cash flow which indicates that the company has reached enough cash from issuing stocks and borrowing money. As the net change in cash over the years has seen tremendous fluctuations, it is notable that the company is ideally not in a stable position to accumulate enough cash and can hence face liquidity challenges. In recent time, the net balance has improved but the company might have to make more efforts to neutralise its past losses.
The company data from the table shows a beautifully rising revenue growth curve in the past 5 years with the company touching 2235 Cr. Rs. revenue in the year 2023. The operating profit margin faced slow growth until 2022 post which it has been seen to be slowly declining. While shareholders have found a good deal with this company, it needs to be monitored for future variations in numbers. Overall net profit margin has been actively maintained by the company till 2022 and shows minor variations. It is imperative that the company balances its revenues and its expenses in order to generate an upward profit margin with time.
The balance statement data of the company shows fluctuating numbers for total assets over the past five years. The year 2019 has seeing a stunning dip in the total assets possessed by the company as the numbers touch 1118 Cr. Rs. This might indicate an overall decrease in the market condition or an obstacle in the path of the company that had prevented itself from expanding its market base. The current assets have been maintained in the same trend over the years and the company seems to have saved money to fund is operational activities productively. It is an interesting fact to know that the total liability incurred by the company in the year 2022 has seen declining figures. This is a sign of marked financial stability as it indicates that the company has no obligation to repay to its creditors and that the company can progress towards its goals. The total equity values have also seen an upsurge ensuring that the company gains the support of investors from all fronts.
From the given table it is evident that the company has gone down in terms of maintaining its open cash balance over the years and thus the trends show some decline. Though the company has tried to maintain a positive outlook towards maintaining its operating cash flow, the numbers are quite appreciative as compared to other companies during the same period. It is hence proven that the company generates cash from its core operations and day to day activities which helps to maintain a balance in its net cash change. The amount of profit the company makes from its investing activities has decreased in the past 4 years. So it is clear that the company might have been debt or into rebuying of stocks. All though the company had been running negative in terms of the net change in cash in 2022, it has made an effort to pull up its socks and make a positive change in its net cash value in the year 2023 which is a good sign for all its investors.
The statistics shown in the above table highlight the financial figures of the company in the past five years. The company has been performing exceptionally well in maintaining an overall upward growth in its operational profit margin with a minor variation in 2022 which is indespensable for the prosperity of the company in the long run. While the organisation faced a major decline in the net profit margin in the year 2019 when it touched 14.81%, it has been steadily catching up with the competitive market and has increased its profit margin to 37.81% in 2020. The company's earnings per shares have also witnessed a massive upscale reaching 75.44 Rs. from 30.15 Rs. and throws light on the fact that the company has been able to establish a good worth in the market.
The balance sheet shows the financial data of a company which highlights that it is under the need to significantly take efforts to decrease its debt to equity over the years. The book value of the company stands at the highest range of 440.96 Cr. Rs. in 2023, the highest in the past 5 years. Thus the company has critically increased its asset margin in the past five years and the total liabilities have approximately been maintained at a fair range and would be better if compensated. The company shall enjoy the support of its investors and is in a stable position to sustain itself for conquering higher goals.
The statistical reports of the company from its financial cash flow data obtained from the table depicts the consistent increase in the opening cash balance of the company in the past 5 years. The year 2023 has seen a striking decrease in its opening cash balance. The company has maintained a consistent cash flow from its operating activities until the year 2021, post which the graph has likely gone down. This indicates that the company has been able to generate comparatively lesser profit from its day to day activities. The company is also under the influence of excess capital expenditures or investments. From the data obtained from the cash flow investing activities we can conclude that the company had been running really low in terms of maintaining profitable investments. In the year 2023, the cash flow from investing activities has reached the lowest point of -655.62 Cr. Rs. which focuses on the need to reconsider its investing strategies and investment choices. It is a positive sign that the company has not been in debt recruitment in the past two years which will help the company to prosper significantly. However the financial flexibility of the company has seen an overall dip as of 2023, when the net change in cash flow is observed to be -61.27 Cr. Rs. This might indicate liquidity challenges that the company has been recently facing.
The data obtained from the table reflects a mixed variation over the four years in terms of financial stability of the company. The revenue data shows upward growth touching 5634 Cr. Rs in 2023. It is notable that the operating profit margin of the company has decreased conspicuously 2022 onwards and has been on the decline till date. This might eye to a necessity to cut down its management costs or cost of labour. Since operational efficiency has been fairly good as is evident from the EBITDA values, there is not much need for reconstruction of its ideas to channelise the company and its growth in the upward direction. The company faced a bad time in the year 2023 with a dip in its net profit margin and has seen a decrease in its earnings per share too. However, it is struggling to increase the value and settle in the existing market.
The balance sheet data obtained from the given table indicates increasing numbers in terms of the total assets possessed by the company. The company had reached a slightly lower value of total assets in the year 2019 after which it has maintained its upward growth until it reaches the highest value of 2634 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has been investing  on its day to day activities or to support the operational areas. While the total liabilities of the company has seen an upward growth, it is needless to say that the liability count should be monitord. The year 2020 had seen a significant dip in the total equity value of the company which indicates that the company might have been facing challenges in maintaining a financially prosperous state. The common stock values have been consistent but the book value has to be maintained over the years which will make the company have better future prospect and can attract investors in the long run.
The statistics of the company in the past 4 years is clearly depicted from its cash flow table given. It is to be taken into account that the company had been performing exceptionally well in terms of maintaining a stability in its core operations in the past 2 years. In 2021, it reached -71.06 Cr. Rs. Over the years it has been able to stabilize its profit and make revenue from its core operations. However this indicates that the cash flow from investing activities is still on the negative side, which means that the company has not been making complete and full investments. Though the situation had become better in 2021, the company still has a long way to go in order to make profit from investing activities. The company is still in debt as is depicted via the negative value of its cash flow from financial activities. Hence overall the net change in cash has improved in 2023, it has seen some improvement in net cash flow in the past year.
With expenses on the rise, it is notable from the given table that the company is struggling to maintain a stable margin of profit from its increasing revenues. It is necessary that the company makes an attempt at cost effective measures so as to have the profit curve on the rise. While its overall market worth has increased with time and its earnings per share have touched the 22.56 Rs. mark, it needs to take measures to enhance its overall profit and have a stable hold in the rapidly developing market. It is however a point of attraction for shareholders and investors and should be looked at with optimism.
The data obtained from the balance sheet shows a steady growth in the total asset value of the company from 2019-2023 with negligible ups and downs. The company seems to have not faced any liquidity challenges or operational downfall. The company has been successful in maintaining an upward growth of its book values in 2021-2023 which has touched the height of 108.36 Cr. Rs. in 2023. Thus the company is safe in the competitive market. Having strong current assets is essential for a company to meet its short-term debt obligations and the company seems to have slightly gone down in this domain in the past 2 years. Growth in equity over the years eye to the fact that the company has been able to curtail its operating expenses over the past 3 years which is important to uphold the sanctity of the company in the long run.
The trend in the overall opening balance over the years shows an increasing curve which highlights that the company has been maintaining a fairly good amount of revenue to sustain its daily needs. The year 2019 has seen a huge downfall in its cashflow from operating activities, which might indicate that the company had been running low in terms of efficiency and had made lesser cash out of its core operations. However in recent years it has been able to compensate for the loss and has made enough profit from its operational sector which is indespensable for a stable foothold. Investments made by the company have resulted in sufficient results as is evident from the positive values of cash flow obtained form investing activities except for the last year. It is noteworthy that the company has recovered itself from the state of debt it was in 2022, when it fell off to -4.72 Cr. Rs. and has been able to maintain a positive value in the next year. With the net change in cash reaching 239.45 Cr. Rs. as of 2023, the company seems to have been able to maintain a balance between the net inflow and outflow of cash.
It is to be noted from the given table that the company has been instrumental in maintaining a good value of revenue over the years and the numbers have prosperously increased over the years. Thus it indicates that the customers or consumers of its products and services have been showing a positive response. While the company peaked in terms of operational efficiency in the year 2019, it faced a slight decline in the year 2021 post which it steadily regained its position. Overall, the data shows mixed numbers and should be monitored in the long run to come to a conclusion regarding any financial aspect of the company.
The graph of financial figures obtained from the given balance sheet of a company shows some interesting properties. The total revenue generation of the company has been fairly consistent over the years and is depicted from the total asset count of the company which has been constantly on the upward margin. It also has some non current assets which might be an investment for a long term. Total liabilities of the company have also increased in the year which is a warning that the company needs to pay of its creditors in the near future. As we see an increase in the total equity value, it sends a message that the company's worth in the market might have gone up in the recent scenario and the value of its shares and stocks have seen a consequent upgrade. The book value of the company has seen improvements in the past 5 years currently it stands at 247.77 Cr. Rs. which is a fairly positive figure.
The net change in cash is an important parameter which depicts the overall financial strength of a company and its capability to sustain itself in the long run. It is notable how the company has not been able to recover itself from the state of negative cash change in the year 2023 when it reached the bottom line of -419.06 Cr. Rs. The earnings from operating activities has been on the rise and gives us a positive outlook about the company. The company needs to work more on strategic investments in order to grow the numbers generated from its investing activities. This would act as a catalyst in increasing the net cash flow by a greater margin. It seems like the company has also involved itself in stock buybacks or is under the pressure of repayment of debts as the values from its financing activities have drastically declined to -1968 Cr. Rs. over the years.
The financial reports of the company from the given table show variation and ups and downs in numbers. Over the years from 2019-2020 the company has been maintaining  its revenues in the increasing range until it reached 503.11 Cr. Rs. in the year 2020. Expenses have increased proportionally. In the year 2023, the company has witnessed a slight dip in the net profit range and consequently its operating margin. The value of earnings per share has also gone down from 46.48 Rs. in 2020 to 28.18 Rs. in 2022 which does not give much hope for shareholders and investors about the future prospects of the company.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has incurred huge profit which is depicted from its net total assets. The total assets of the company has always been maintained and has been constantly on the rise. The current assets of the company seems to have slightly gone down in 2023 which means that the company has not seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has increased gradually which represents that the company has been able to improve its current worth in the market with time and this is a sign of marked prosperity for the company in the coming years.
The data fetched from the table shows concerning numbers of the net change in cash as the company seems to have touched the -377.10 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2021. This highlights a dropdown in the company profits and is a risk in the path of sustainable growth. The opening cash balance of the company has also dipped to 29.79 Cr. Rs., so it is needless to say that the company is not doing fine in terms of revenue generation every consistent year. The positive value of cash flow generated from operating activities depicts that the company has been able to accumulate cash from its prominent operations on a daily basis and is on the positive side. A lot of work is still needed on the investment front as the cash from investing activities is on the decline. This emphasises the need to reform its investment plans to maintain a higher net change in cash.
The data shown in the table depicts an optimistic view towards the company's financial status. The net profit margin of the company is maintained at a fairly consistent rate and the earnings per share has seen an increase in the year 2023. It is a commendable job on the company's part to have been able to maintain an upward growth of operational efficiency in the competitive market scenario. Revenue generation has been in full swing over the years and has touched the highest point in 2023 at 2073 Cr. Rs.  While expenses have risen and peaked in 2023 at 1870 Cr. Rs. the company has been capable of balancing the numbers. Thus, the company might continue to flourish in the market with sheer prosperity and some care.
The data obtained from the table is a comparison of the companies balance statement as depicted in the years 2021-2023. The company has comparatively increased its total assets in the year 2023 followed by an increase in its non current assets too. The company has not been investing much on long term prospects and has enough capital to finance its short term operations. The total liabilities of the company have been on a steady rise while it's non current liability has also seen the same trend with little variations. 2023 has seen an increase in the net equity value of the company which is a remark of enhanced financial stability. The company has also been able to maintain a consistent rate of stocks which makes it a central point of attraction from shareholders as they do not expect much fluctuations in the companies net market worth.
The statistical reports of the company as is obtained form the cash flow table lays emphasis on the fact that the company has been struggling to maintain an optimum level of cash from operating activities. The net cash balance has escalated in 2023 which is remarkable. The negative numbers are a proof to the fact that the company is spending more cash than it is making more of deinvestments. This can be concerning and requires further analysis to understand the root cause and potential implications. The cash from investing activities has gone down in the year 2023 to -122.44 Cr. Rs. Thus the company needs to push brakes on its investments and tackle liquidity challenges. Overall, the company has to make significant effort in maintaining better investment standards.
A mark of concern for all shareholders of this company is the fact that the profitability and earnings per share of the company have significantly dipped to negative values over the years. This raises questions on the future financial stability of the company and needs to be monitored in the long run. Revenue has increased in the last year but the company is still at a loss. Expenses have increased hand in hand and needs to be curtailed in order to increase the net profit margin. The efficiency of its workforce has been maintained over the years and is a positive sign. Overall, the data shows mostly downward trend and it is imperative that the company makes reorganisational steps to reduce its overheads and in turn, amplify its profits.
A significant contribution of the company towards its shareholders and overall growth and development in the years 2019 to 2023 is clearly depicted from the balance sheet given in the picture. The company has faced a steep increase in assets over the years and this has resulted in an improved financial stability of the company. The company has a huge amount of non current assets withstanding in its name which point to the fact that it has made huge investment in long term prospects which are less liquid in nature. The common stock has slightly increased in value in the year 2023 and is a boon for all its shareholders. Thus the company is at a position of investor expectations that it shall be much more profitable in the future.
The financial reports obtained from the table depict that the company had reached its peak point in the year 2022 where the net change in cash value stood at 843.45 Cr. Rs., the highest in the past 5 years. In 2023, the company faced a massive decline as the net cash succumbed to -752.39 Cr. Rs. showing marked decline in the prosperity of the company. The company might have been involved in stock repayments or buy backs as a result of which the cash obtained from these financial activities witnessed a major decline. Though the company has tried to pull up its socks to enhance the net cash flow margin in the previous years, it is running into loss as is noted from the drastic low in figures.
The financial situation of the company is at a quite fruitful state as is evident from the recent increase in the net profit margin in the year 2023. The net profit margin has gone up to 13.47% and the company's share values have touched 4.89 Rs. consequently. This is a matter of sheer concern for shareholders and brings up questions on the future prospects of the company. While revenue generation has been maintained on the go, the company still has to reach higher goals of stabilizing its overall operating profit margin in order to gain the trust of its shareholders.
The data obtained from the given balance sheet table of a company shows a number of aspects about the financial ups and downs faced by the company from the year 2019 to 2023. Book value of the company has constantly been on the rise touching the mark of 55.62 Cr. Rs. in the year 2022 after which it has seen a sudden downfall . This is a sign that there hasn't been much non cash charge recorded from the companies side. The company has been successful in maintaining a high equity value over the years which is a positive sign that the company's operating performance has been at par. This is a testament of the fact that the company has not incurred excess debt to finance. The debt to equity of the company has remained negligible which means that the company has taken efforts to make significant neutralisation of monetary assets towards its creditors.
The table demonstrates the ups and downs in net cash flow for a company over the span of 5 years from 2019-2023. In 2021, the company had faced a rapid decline in its core operational profit which has resulted in a decline of the numbers to 45.01 Cr. Rs. The company has revived its status in the past one year which is indeed a positive sign that the status of the company is showing a marked improvement. Though the trends show consistent values, the scenario as of 2023 shows a brighter side of the picture which is necessary for the development of the company in the future.
The reports obtained from the table demonstrate a positive upward curve in revenue generation over the years from 2019-2023. The company has reached its maximum revenues in the past year touching 7354 Cr. Rs. in 2022 . However its EBITDA count has shown a massive downfall. The company's expenses have increased at a higher rate over the years which has cause the company to reach a state of debt. While the net profit margin shows consequent fall over the years, the company is trying hard to increase its profit margin. The earnings per share has reached -1.77 Rs which is indeed not a good news for its shareholders.
It is evident from the given table of the company's balance sheet that the company has made significant decrease in asset generation over the years 2019 to 2023. As a result the company has not been able to maintain a stable state throughout the years. The increase in current assets of the company throw light on the point that the company has a lot of short term withstanding cash. Hand in hand the liabilities have gone down too and touched 25700 Cr. Rs. as of 2021. It is significant to note that the non-current liabilities have currently declined a little which might indicate that the company has mitigated some of its long term obligations that it had towards other companies. The total equity range is on the steep decline which is an indication that the company is depending a lot on external sources and does not have effective business strategies. Overall the company is in a pretty poor financial position and may look forward to increasing market revenue and asset levels to compensate for the loss.
The reports of cash flow data from the table show positive numbers for the net income from operating activities which indicates that the company has been able to maintain a good standard of its core operations and ensures efficiency. However, the trend in cash flow from investing activities shows a steep decline reaching negative numbers which points to the fact that the company has been investing too much on external and internal resources. This has dropped the net cash flow by a deep margin 2021 onwards. In order to generate an upward net cash flow curve, it is necessary that the company curtails its worthless investments and channelises its strategies towards an effective investment plan.
It is a conspicuous change that we see in the numbers obtained from the table. The earnings per share of the company had drastically gone down in the year 2021 touching 159.98 Rs. As a result the net profit margin had reached a very low end of 2.92%. The revenue generation policy had clearly failed in the year 2020 as the expenses continued to rise. In recent years the company has seen moderate progress but has made some gradual improvement in increasing its net profit margin to 3.97% It still has some effort to be made in the upcoming years in order to establish a sustainable hold in the market.
The tremendous upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of sheer prosperity for the company in the years 2019-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name which can be converted to cash without a significant loss in value. The equity of the company has touched the 7282 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2022 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown a straight dip in the year 2023 touching 1601 Cr. Rs. post which the company should steadily regain hold of its financial strength and escalate the book value. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The data obtained from the table gives us a clear picture of the company which has been struggling to maintain its opening cash balance steadily from the year 2022. Though the company had been starting with an opening cash balance of -157.22 Cr. Rs. as of 2019, the company has been able to pull its socks up and keep in pace with the current market scenario. The cash flow from investing activities had highly dipped as of the year 2022 where it touched - 1705 Cr. Rs. but the company has tried to improve its status in the following years. The company has maintained a steady cash flow from financing activities as the current positive values might be an indication of successful debt repayment. Overall the net cash balance has been positive but has comparatively gone down as compared to what it was in 2021.
The data obtained from the table shows mixed numbers.. The earnings per share of the company has seen a certain downfall in the year 2023 when it touched 6.85 Rs. from 22.00 Rs. as that of 2020. The revenue curve has been on the rise which shows that there is consistency in the revenue generation strategies and overall market that the company deals in. The expenses of the company have also gone higher every year. The company has been able to increase its revenues but has seen a downfall in the net profit margin. The overall market value of the company has decreased and this may have an impact on the shareholders of the company.
From the data fetched from the given balance sheet of a company, it is easy to point out that the total assets of the company has seen an increase over the years with a maximum increase gap from the year 2022 to 2023. The current assets of the company has also increased in the same rate thus indicating that the company has enough financial stability to make a smooth operation of all its daily activities. The total liabilities of the company has seen a sudden spike in the year 2023 when it touched 14897 Cr. Rs. This figure needs to be compensated in order to ensure that the company is able to sustain itself financially and does not resort to a state of risk. The total equity of the company has shown an upward growth, needless to say that the company has been performing appreciably well and is in the center of attraction of investors and shareholders.
The table shown in the image is a clear demonstration of the highly fluctuating cash flow values of a company in the past 5 years. Though the company had been progressively heading 2021 onwards, the year 2020 had seen a drastic downfall in the net change in cash flow. This might indicate liquidity challenges faced by the company. It is also to be kept in mind that the company is making a loss in terms of cash flow from financial activity and the values have touched highly poor margins -400.81 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. It is a point of concern for the investors and the company likewise. It is a good sign that the company has been able to maintain an increase in terms of cash flow from operating activities in the past year. This highlights that the company has enough wealth to sustain its daily activities too.
The statistics we see from the given income statement table indicates that there has been a subtle increase in the revenue count of the company in the year 2023. The highest revenue touched has been 1029 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. Expenses have gone in upward direction as well after a minor dip in 2021 which has led to and overall decrease in the net profit margin of the company in 2022. The current net profit margin stands at 12.59% which means that the company has been able to balance its growing expenses and revenue generation strategies. As the earnings per share continue to be at the consistent level, it is to be noted that the value has decreased a little in 2022 than what it was in the year 2021. Thus we see some fluctuations in the figures of the company which is a matter of concern.
The trends in the total assets of the company as seen from the given balance sheet depicts an overall steady upward growth of revenue. The company has been able to sustain itself with a fair amount of non current assets as well as maintain an optimum amount of current assets for its everyday operations. Liabilities of the company has seen a net growth over the years which is a sign that the company has not been able to cut down the overhead expenses that it owed to its creditors. However the non current liabilities are under control which typically include long-term debt. This can also be seen as a way for the company to finance long-term investments but also increases the financial risk of the company. Common stock values of the company has been consistent which is definitely a plus point for its shareholders. The company has also been able to maintain a lower value of debt to equity over the past 2 years.
The data obtained from the table shows the variation in cash flow values of a company throughout the last 5 years. As is evident from the table, the opening cash balance of the company has been fluctuating in numbers with consistent ups and downs. The cash flow from operating activities had risen up to a high of 100.80 Cr. Rs. in 2022 which is indeed a positive sign for the future development of the company. However the numbers have seen a decline by a huge margin in the year 2023 where it reached 58.29 Cr. Rs. This might eye to the fact that the company has been making lesser cash than it is spending on its operational sector. A noteworthy aspect for the company is the positively increasing value of a cash flow from investing activities in the year 2023 after a low value. This ensures that the company is making strategic Investments and is on the right track towards making right Investments and taking the right decisions. The cash flow from financing activities has seen a steep decline in the year 2023 when it touched - 24.48 Cr. Rs. This is a sign that the company might not have been making enough profit from its overall expenditure and investment. This number needs to be clearly monitored in order to stabilize the company in the long run. This will further impact the trend in net change in cash flow over the years.
It is evident from the given figures that the company has been doing good in terms of revenue generation over the years. The net profit margin of the company has overall increased in the year 2022 touching 8.67% The expenses of the company has been continuously on the rise which is impactful enough on the financial standards of the company. The dividends per share value has consequently decreased in comparison to what it was in the year 2022 which throws doubts on the fact that the investor rate might be hampered.
The statistics obtained from the given balance sheet table of a company is a representative of the fact that the company has seen ups and downs in its revenue growth over the years. Total asset of the company had consequently decreased in the year 2019 when it touched 1811 Cr. Rs., post which the company has been able to make the curve grow. The current assets of the company is in good number which shows that the financial everyday needs of the company should not be compromised with. Liability also show ups and downs. As of 2023, the total liability has touched 2043 Cr. Rs. and needs to be reduced by a far greater margin. The company has also been involved in non current liabilities which might be a strategy for maintaining long-term investments. The total equity of the company had strangely gone down in the year 2020 when it touched down to 490.83 Cr. Rs. , which indicates that the company had seen a decline in its financial status. However in the following years it has been able to regain its original state and make a mark in the rapidly developing market with a higher book value and a good position. It can look into its liability mitigation plans in order to stay on the safer side.
The data obtained from the table highlights the trending cash flow values of a company in the past 5 Years from 2019 to 2023. The company has been maintaining fairly good revenues initially post which it has gone down to 83.51 Cr. Rs. of opening balance. The company has been running fairly well in terms of generating enough cash flow from its operational sectors. As of 2023, the cash flow from its operating activities has touched 716.74 Cr. Rs. which is a proof of the sustainability of the day-to-day activities of the organisation. Liquid cash flow from financing activities has seen a fluctuating trend since the past 5 years. The company had a tough time in 2020 with -168.56 Cr. Rs. net cash flow which can indicate that the company was facing liquidity challenges. The cash flow had increased by a positive margin in the year 2022 but has fallen down to negative values again in the past year which might indicate a sheer sign of loss. Though the company has been able to maintain a positive net change in cash in 2022, the company has not been able to maintain a stable financial status in 2023.
The data as seen from the income statement table of the given company shows a transition in numbers in the financial parameters of the company in the past 5 years. The revenue of the company had gone down in the year 2021 when it touched 7840 Cr. Rs.. The expenses had also decreased at the same margin which might indicate that the company had seen and overall reduction in its market value. The EBITDA values continued to rise until 2023. Thus we conclude that the company has decreased its operational efficiency. The operating profit margin has also seen a negative progress across the period of 5 years which clearly shows that the company is going towards its declining phase. It has been running into a state of loss and might have a detrimental impact if the trend prevails.
It is evident from the given balance sheet of the company that over the years between 2021 to 2023 the company has witnessed a steady growth in its total assets. This might reflect that the company has spread across the country or expanded its sectors over a wider market base. Total equity of the company had gone at its lowest in the year 2019 which is definitely not a good sign and shows that the company had not been able to repay back its creditors at a considerable progressive rate. Assets of the company have increased over the years and is essential in order to maintain the smooth functioning of the company. The debt to equity value of the company as seen from the table has decreased over the last 2 years and will attract shareholders in the future. Another prominent feature is the net rise in book value every year which indicates that the company has enough financial strength and shall not resort into a state of debt or financial risk.
It is evident from the given picture that the company has been trying hard to make strategic investments in the right areas in the past five years and thus reduce the loss in negative cash flow from investing activities. The margin of revenue earned from cash flow of operating activities has shown a decrease in the past year. Cash flow from financing activities had drastically gone down in the year 2018 post which it has seen moreover same status. In 2023 the cash flow from financing activities has dropped again to -715.30 Cr. Rs. The overall net change in cash needs to be balanced to indicate the overall stability and sustainability of the company.
The data from the table signifies a decline in the operating profit margin of the company in the year 2021 which is indicative of a dip in the functional aspects of the organisation. It is to be noted that the net profit margin has also decreased over the years reaching a point of -48.72% in 2021. While the earnings per share has been on an average range after consecutive years of negative numbers, investors can have faith on its numbers. The company has been performing well in terms of revenue generation as of 2023 but as the expenses continue to increase, it still has a long way to go in terms of maintaining an optimum amount of profit margin.
The statistical reports obtained from the table is a testament of the asset management of the company in the past 5 years. The table shows highly positive values in increasing revenue, with the current assets of the company witnessing a steady growth. However it is indispensable to note that the total liabilities of the company has drastically increased with time and the company owes a huge amount of current liabilities. As of 2020 the company had a few non-current liabilities that throw light on the fact that it had not been much involved in long-term plans. Total equity of the company has been rising steadily until 2022 but has seen a gradual decline in the last year which might eye to challenges that the company might be facing in establishing or expanding its market across a vital customer base. The debt to equity values have decreased in comparison to the previous year but the company has still a long way to go in order to reduce the total debt to equity value and make a stronger hold in the market.
It is needless to point out that the statistics of the company as depicted in the given cash flow table is one with varying numbers. The company has always maintained a negative opening cash throughout the past years with a sudden upscale in 2023. There is a high escalation in the value for cash flow from operating activities as of the past three years. This emphasizes on the fact that the company is able to make good margin of money from its core activities. While the company has a lot of effort to be demonstrated in maintaining a higher value of cash flow from its investing activities, this might be an indication that the company is involving itself in repayment of stocks or buyback of stocks and is thus running into a state of debt. Overall the company has witnessed a positive net change in cash as of 2022, after 3 consistent years of negative values. This is indeed a sign of marked improvement.
With every incoming year, the expenses continue to increase and has touched 1950 Cr. Rs. as of 2023. It is to be noted that the company has not proved to be efficient enough to balance its increasing expenses and steadily improve its net profit margin. While the company had gone down in terms of operational efficiency in 2022, shareholders and invetsors will definitely be attracted to its increased market value. Earnings per share have reached 39.28 Rs. in the year 2023 which is a sign of growth and better future prospects. Overall, the financial position of the company in the market is commendable at this stage and can be relied on.
The given data fetched from the companies balance sheet report gives and insight into the financial status of the company and its asset management strategies over the years 2019 to 2023. The current assets of the company has also been on the rise and there is no fear of a sudden loss or shortage of finances for the daily run of the company. However it is considerable to know that the total liabilities have increased over the years with lesser rate of non current liabilities. It does not have very long term Investment plans in mind but needs to work on mitigating the current liabilities and bringing them down to a stand still. The appreciative part is the net rise in the total equity values which stands at 7931 Cr. Rs. as of 20203. The data is thus indicative of a positive upward growth of the company and shows prospects of gaining more investing funds.
In the given picture of the cash flow table of a company across the years 2019 to 2023, we observe varying trends in all cash flow parameters. The company had been struggling in generating optimum cash flow growth from its operating activities in the year 2022 and had been running on 46.50 Cr. Rs. However in the past 3 years it has been able to pull its socks up and show a positive net cash flow. The company has been investing probably too much into the wrong areas as a result of which it has been able to make minimum returns from its investment. While the company is struggling to stay consistent with a positive value of financing activity cash flow, the curve has stooped down in the past year. The company is in an overall positive position in terms of the net cash profit it has encountered throughout the year. This trend needs to be maintained in the future in order to ensure the prosperity of the company.
The company statistics show prosperous numbers in terms of revenue generataion in the past 5 years. The net profit margin of the company in the past 5 years show dynamic statistics. The year 2023 has seen a massive downfall of the company when the profit margin had gone as low as 7.39% as compared to 11.26% in the year 2019. Consequently it faced a huge setback in terms of operating profit margin too. Earnings per share had gone down to 43.17 Rs. and the company seems to have gone through a rough time. However it has made a strong comeback in recent years and is still in the phase of reviving its previous statistics. As earnings per share touch 58.41 Rs. in the last year, investors can have good opportunities with this company in the near future.
The given balance sheet table of the company is a representative of the current financial status of the company and gives hints about its future prospects. Current assets have seen an upsurge over time in 2023 when it touched 946 Cr. Rs. The company might have changed its strategies or has been involved in operational plans which led to a sudden increase in its current asset margin. With the current liability on the rise, the company holds enough money to convert into cash in a short term, while the total equity values continue to increase. The debt to equity value has significantly gone down in the year 2023 which is a positive aspect deciphered from the table. Hence the company shall attract investors as per the latest trends and can look forward to a brighter future.
A striking feature observed about the company from the given image depicting the cash flow trends is that, the company had been performing exceptionally in terms of maintaining a positive change in cash flow until 2023. In the year 2023 the company has gone down by high margin which is a matter of concern if the trend keeps on repeating in the upcoming years. The prime reason behind this deviation is the decrease in cash flow from investing activities which has dropped by a heavy margin in the past one year. Trends in cash flow from operating activities present a mixed picture. The company had failed at making money from its core operations in the year 2020 and has revived its previous position by a partial margin in the following years. Net change in cash as of 2023 stands at -481.55 Cr. Rs. which is a sign of huge loss for the company. Overall the company has still a lot of effort to be made in terms of maintaining a net positive change in cash over the years.
The overall trend of the company throws light on two aspects mainly - the company has been maintaining fairly good range of revenue though the progress is slow and the profit margin over the years has significantly gone down and gone up demonstrating poor planning or operational strategies. It is a felt need for the company to balance the rate of increasing expenses or cut down its expenditures so as to stabilize the growth of the company and makes the numbers count. Over the years the company has increased in worth as is noted from the increasing values of earnings per share which varies from -2.77 Rs. in the year 2022 to 15.27 Rs. in the year 2023. It is imperative for investors to keep an account of the dividends per share made by the company over the years as the values have gone down.
The balance statement of the company as seen in the first five years period indicates an amazing performance in the last one year. The debt to equity has seen a corresponding decrease. It is notable that the total equity of the company has risen and reflects the financial progress of the company. It has also been involved in long term investment plans and debt mitigation strategies as is evident from the slight decrease in total liability in the past year. Overall the company looks to be at a fair position and has been able to maintain its revenue generation process by a good margin.
The year 2023 witnessed a drastic decline of the company as the net change in cash flow values had touched the negative number bottom line of -9030 Cr. Rs. Just at the same instance, the cash flow from investing activities had also touched -233.55 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well. In the past 5 years the company has been trying to maintain a positive value of operating activities cash flow but has failed in 2023 which might not help to sustain the day to day activities. The company needs to push brakes on investment and try to compensate for the losses incurred due to fairly declining value of cash from investing activities. It is a positive aspect that the net change in cash value has risen up until 2022 and would be beneficial for the company to maintain growth at the same rate in the upcoming years.
The revenue generated by the company, as is evident from the given table, is the maximum in the past one year. Thus, the company is making good money and is flourishing in terms of operational efficiency too. The company had been performing low in the year 2023 with minimum profit margin but needs to get back to its original phase. The profit margin as of 2023 stands at 3.72% which is a tremendously low count as compared to the previous years. Shareholders may not rely on the company the earnings per share have touched 24.85 Rs. in the year 2023 and the company does not look profitable enough in the current marlet scenario.
From the given table, transitions in asset management trends that the company has witnessed in the last five years is quite prominent. The company has a lot to repay to its creditors. The count of liabilities have been curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been falling in the same pattern which might be a part of the companies future growth. The total equity of the company has a massive rise in the last one year touching 7053 Cr. Rs. , and is a positive sign for all its shareholders. The debt to equity values of the company has seen a consequent decrease in the past years which might represent the fact that the company does not owe a lot of money to other businesses. This number needs to be maintained in the long run and the company needs to follow the same trend in order to make the numbers count.
It is essential for a company to maintain a net positive cash flow balance throughout in order to ensure that the company relies on well accumulated cash which would in turn enhance the financial flexibility of the company. The table thus shows a downfall of the company in this respect in the years 2022-2023. The company has also been unable to maintain quite a good margin of profit from financial activities as of 2023 and has faced a severe low when it touched the -1862 Cr. Rs. mark. The company might have deinvested in that particular year or had been in debt, which it failed to professionally compensate and thus lead to a decline of the net worth of the company.
The data shown in the table indicates the financial status of the company in the past 5 years and presents an overall picture. The company has been steadily growing in terms of net profit margin until 2021 which is imperative for sustaining the company in the long run. Overall the profits have risen from 24.83% in 2019 to 38.71% in 2021. While the year 2019 has seen a minor dip in revenues, the organisation has managed to pull up its socks and further set the revenue curve on the rise. As of 2023, it stands at 965.62 Cr. Rs., the highest in the past 5 years, which is indeed an optimistic count for shareholders and investors likewise. It is notable that there is a marked imbalance maintainted between the revenue and expenses values, which has led the company to generate lesser profit over the years. The operational functions of the company also seem to be in full swing as is evident from the EBITDA value and has reached greater heights in recent years. Thus, shareholders will definitely be attracted to the rising prosperity of the company and hold optimistic hopes.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has increased drastically in the year 2023 touching 1152 Cr. Rs. The current assets of the company seems to have followed the same pattern which means that the company has seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has witnessed steep downfall in 2021 when it reached the  bottomline of 50.81 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had been going through a rough time in handling its liabilities and had degraded its financial situation. However it is trying to recuperate the figures in the upcoming years.
The data fetched from the table is indicative of the point that the company had declined by a steep margin in the year 2023 due to greater amout of deinvestments. Hand in hand, it had not been able to gather enough cash from financing or via issuing stocks which further added to the negative values. In recent years, the trend in cash flow from operating activities is seen to have been on the rise at a higher margin which is a positive note. It clearly indicates that the company is able to sustain enough cash for its daily activities and shall not lead to the downfall of the company. The overall cash balance as of 2023 stands at -45.48 Cr. Rs. which is ideally not a profitable lumpsum amount and shows the financial strength of the company to be very unstable. However, this data needs to be transitioned in the upcoming years with more strategic efforts.
The company statistics demonstrated in the given table show a marked decline in the amount of revenues generated in the years 2021-2022. Initially the company was capable of making 1461 Cr. Rs.  in the year 2019  which slowly declined over the years and fell down to 653.36 Cr. Rs. in the year 2022. The company seems to be struggling in terms of maintaining an optimum level of efficiency at work too. However from 2023 onwards, it has been able to upgrade itself and increase its revenues by a good margin. Currently its expenses have increased too, which indicates the company is spending good amount of money on its labour and resources. It still needs to make a lot of progress in maintaining a balance between its revenues and expenses as the profit margin shows strict variations. The earnings per shares of the company have gone down in the past one year which eyes at the net worth of the company in the current market. Thus, the company still needs to make some progress in order to be an eye-catcher for shareholders and market investors and fetch fruitful returns.
The statistic reports of the company in terms of its balance sheet as depicted in the table prove that the company has been able to maintain a slow but gradual increase in its total equity in the past 3 years. This is important in order to make a strong financial hold in the market. The equity levels had gone down initially and touched the lowest point in 2020, post which it has revived its status. Current assets of the company has also touched the mark of 3087 Cr. Rs. which shows that the company has enough of cash to support itself and its operating activities. However it has slightly gone down in the year 2023. Assets have always been on the rise. The company might have faced support challenges in terms of revenue generation in the year 2019 or has witnessed an overall reduction in market condition. While the common stock value has increased throughout, the book value has seen subtle decline which is also a negative sign for the company in the long run. Investors might look forward to prospects with this company with sheer optimism.
The year 2022 has witnessed a drastic decline of the company as the net change in cash flow values had touched the negative number bottom line of -62.38 Cr. Rs. Just at the same instance, the cash flow from investing activities had also touched -73.67 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well. In the past 5 years the company has been trying to maintain a positive value of operating activities cash flow but has witnessed a sudden decline in the year 2021. The company has pushed brakes on investment and tried to compensate for the losses incurred due to fairly declining value of cash from investing activities. As a result, the cash flow from investing activities touched the 230.60 Cr. Rs. mark. It is to be monitored that the net change in cash value has fallen down 2022 onwards and could be a hindrance for the company to maintain growth in the upcoming years.
The data from the table shows a prominent loss incurred by the company in the past five years and is indicative of the slow progress and decline of the company. Unfortunately the company has not been performing efficiently in terms of net profits as the values are still at negative standpoints. Though the revenues have increased over the years, the higher rate of increasing expenses have dominated the income of the company. This also indicates that the company has been spending too much on overhead expenses or fixed resource costs. As a result, the operational profit margin is on the negative side too with slight positivity in the year 2023. Though the company has performed better than the year 2022 in the recent times, it still has a long way to go in order to make a stable hold and sustain itself for long. This is absolutely not the right choice for shareholders and investors at this stage.
The gradual upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of fair financial stability for the company in the years 2020-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name which can be converted to cash without a significant loss in value. The equity of the company has touched the 50.18 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 after consecutive years of negative figures which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown a straight upscale in the year 2023 touching 3.81 Cr. Rs. from the years of negative values which shows that the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value. The common stock values have also been on the rise and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 5 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing fairly well in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years which hints at the fact that the company has been judiciously investing on its strategies and management plans. The operating profit margin has been on the rise but has dropped down in recent times, and it has failed to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin. In the year 2023, net profit margin touched 1.50%, the lowest in the last few years. The company needs to follow the plan of growth and aim at enhancing the numbers strategically. As a result, it is currently not progressing at a steady phase and will definitely be in the limelight of losses if the trend continues.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2012-2023. The burning rate of total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. It is to be noted that the book value of the company has gone up by a good margin in the year 2023. This needs to be maintained in the future. Stock rates of this company have been maintained at a consistent level which is a parameter that might attract shareholders in the long run.
The records of the company as is evident from the cash flow statements holds up a fairly impressive picture of the financial status of the company in the past 2 years. The company's financial strength had been growing in the year 2022 touching the upper bound of 470.41 Cr. Rs. but has seen a decline in the following years. This is not a good sign for a sustainable company in the long run. The year 2023 has seen an escalation in the net revenue generation but the margin is not great enough to maintain an upward growth in the progress of the company.
The statistical report of the company obtained from the table over the span of past 5 years make it clear that the company had performed low in the year 20219 when it touched a profit margin of 4.90%. The following year had also seen a drastic decrease in its operational efficiency as the EBITDA values speak, when it touched the baseline of 458.13 Cr. Rs. The company has been successful in escalating its operational efficiency in the following years. Overall the trends in the net profit margin of the company do pose a much reliable picture. Shareholders might also get attracte to its consistent earnings per share rates. Thus, the company is performing fine in recent times with respect to profit margin and efficiency. It should maintain its upward curve at this pace to maintain a sustainable hold in the market.
The data generated from the table throw light on the trend in balance statement parameters of a particular company. The company has slightly decreased its debt to equity value in the year 2023 which proves greater stability of the company in handling assets. It has been trying to increase its production and efficiency over the years. The total asset values have seen a gradual increase over the years. Hand in hand, total liabilities have also increased with time till 2021 post which it saw a minor dip. There is a felt need to mitigate these values. Failing to compensate for these might let the company into a state of loss. Stock prices of the company have been in an overall consistent range as a result of which the company has been making profit and has been able to win the trust of shareholders but more work is needed to maintain a higher range of book value too.
A mixed trend of records is observed from the cashflow table of the given company in the years from 2019-2023. As of the latest records, the company has significantly gone down to touch a baseline of -49.03 Cr. Rs. loss of net cashflow balance in 2019. This rate of decline continued to improve and the status of the company has significantly improved. The company is already in debt and is in need to reform its investment strategies to ensure a net upward growth of the financial strength graph, but the sudden increase in the net change in cash in 2023 shows some positivity.
The revenue growth of the company shows positive trends over the past five years with conspicuous increase in its values. Expenses have been on the rise too and the company seems to have been trying hard to  push its limits and maintain a balance between the two. It is to be observed that the company has been running low in terms of its operating profit margin which needs to be addressed immediately to ensure maximum productivity. The net profit margin has also seen a gradual decline and has not undergone steep variations. Shareholders have found a suitable spot with its earnings per share reaching slightly higher value of 17.72 Rs. as of 2023. Investors with future prospects in the company can plan for their deals as it is at a fruitful position with its higher values of dividends per share.
The balance statement of the company as seen in the first five years period indicates a downward performance curve across the years. The debt to equity has seen a corresponding increase over the years by a huge margin which raises concerns. It is notable that the total equity of the company has risen and reflects the financial progress of the company. It has also been involved in long term investment plans but its debt mitigation strategies have failed as is evident from the overall structure of liabilities over the years. Overall the company looks to be at a fair position and has been able to maintain its revenue generation process by a good margin.
The records of the company have been a witness to the fact that the company has been declining by a rapid margin in the year 2021 and had unfortunately touched the bottomline of -747.31 Cr. Rs. The company seems to have cut down its daily functioning efficiency as a result of which there is a surprisingly marked decline in its cash flow from operating activities. At the same time the company has been performing exceptionally well at stock rebuys and aset management which is evident from the growing numbers of cash flow from financing activities in the year 2023. However the two parameters have resulted in a fair balance and the net balance of the company has improved in 2023 from the previous negative numbers.
The given table shows the data over the past 5 years that demonstrate the financial performance of the company. The numbers are demonstrative of a downfall and throw light on the company's decline. The revenue curve has shown a low till 2021 followed by an increase. The enhanced operational efficiency of the company in the year 2023 shows some positivity. The company has been able to maintain an average operating profit margin over the years with steep variation after 2019. In the year 2021, the net profit margin had also seen a low of -1.28%. This is representative of the fact that the company might have had a hard time to cope with its increasing expenses in the year 2022. With increase in the rate of earnings per share the company has been able to successfully draw the attention of its shareholders and promise them a profitable return. Thus the company is at a fairly good position to proceed with its futuristic plans.
From the given table it is a matter to concentrate on the fact that the company has been making slow and gradual progress over the years in terms of total revenue generation, which is evident from the figures of its total assets. The year 2023 has seen an increase in the total asset value by a huge margin when it touched 8452 Cr. Rs. The non current liabilities is a depiction that the company had increased its long term investments in the year 2019 and thus it relies on external resources for funding. Liabilities of the company has increased in the past two years which needs to be monitored and cut down at the earliest. The company also has a good amount of current liability in its name which has increased over the years. This might include short term fulfillment of its obligations which if not taken seriously can put the company at a financial risk. The debt to equity of the company seems to have gone down with time which is a positive sign as the company is not much dependent on its creditors. Thus the company has been maintaining a fair asset margin, and can reach a better position in the market.
The decreasing value of the cash flow generated from investing activities as is evident from the given cash flow table raises a sense of concern in terms of sensible business investment plans and the timing of making these investments. It is appreciative that the company has been able to improve this number in the year 2023. The company has also been struggling over the years to maintain a consistent value of cash flow earnings from its financing activities after facing liquidity challenges in 2021. As a result, it has been able to pull up its socks and get back on the track making a positive figure of cash flow in the year 2022 but is seen to be in the same position again. On a daily basis, things have been going smooth as per the company data but the huge deviation in financial activities has led to a steep decline in its overall net profit margin in the last year which raises concern on its future stability.
The statistical report of the company obtained from the table over the span of past 5 years make it clear that the company has been performing fairly well in terms of revenue generation. The following years have also seen a drastic increase in its operational efficiency as the EBITDA values depict. The company has been successful in escalating its operational efficiency in the year 2021 but faced another fatal blow in the year 2022. Overall the trends in the net profit margin of the company poses a fairly reliable picture. Shareholders might lose interest in the company as the share values are going lower while investors might have  interest in the company's significant progress in terms of dividends per share. The company has still a long way to work on its management and business development approach in order to maintain a sustainable balance in the future.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company till the year 2023, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself over the years. There is a greater scope of potential growth as there is no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company has shown increasing numbers which represents that the company is dependent on external sources to finance its operations. However the obligations of the company in recent years has increased and the liabilities have touched the 1386 Cr. Rs. mark. A positive outlook of the company is presented by the steady growth of equity over the years which might have resulted from selling shares of stocks. Thus the company has grown significantly over the period and is in a stable position in the rapidly developing market.
The data fetched from the table is indicative of the point that the company had declined by a steep margin in the year 2020 due to greater amout of deinvestments. Hand in hand, it had not been able to gather enough cash from financing or via issuing stocks which further added to the negative values. In recent years, the trend in cash flow from operating activities is seen to have gone up and is a sign of credibility for the company. It clearly indicates that the company is able to sustain enough cash for its daily activities and can lead to the betterment of the company. The overall cash balance as of 2023 stands at 8.56 Cr. Rs. which is not a very profitable lumpsum comparitive to the previous years and shows the financial strength of the company to have been compromised with. Thus the company needs to work on itself to look forward to future ventures and stability.
The financial reports of the company show much deviation in the revenue generation curve over the years. The company has been able to make a striking hike in the net profit margin in the year 2023 when the net profit margin reached 4.52% after consequent negative values. Expenses have been maintained at a consistent range too, which throws light on the imbalance in strategic plans of the company with respect to expenditures. The net worth of the company in the market is seen to be increasing as is prominent from the earnings per share values. The EPS values dipped as low as -2.96 Rs. in the year 2020 following which it touched a good height of 10.89 Rs. in 2023. The company seems to have reached a prosperous state at that phase. However the recent trends show that the company still needs to go a long way to look forward to a better progress report.
It is significant to observe that the revenues of the company and in turn the total assets have seen a downfall in the year 2023 where it touched the 2248 Cr. Rs. mark. This is a point of concern as it might impact the overall equity growth of the company if the trend continues. However this has not impacted the net profit of the company and the company has been able to handle itself amidst lesser asset values too. The company has increased its book value and total equity along with maintaining a stable stock rate. It has also reduced its liabilities and proved to have a strong hold.
From the table given above we see a comparison in the cash flow parameters of a company over the years 2019-2023. The opening cash balance of the company has gone down by a huge margin in the year 2023 which eyes at a decreasing rate of revenues of the company. There has been a marked decrease in cash flow from operating activities too in the year 2023. This is a proof that the company has not been able to make good profit from its core functions which is essential for maintaining an equilibrium in day-to-day financial activities. The investing activities have not generated much cash in the span of five years which lays emphasis on the fact that the company might have made too many divestments or significant capital expenditures. The negative values of cash flow through financial activities also mean that the company might be under debt for a short period of time. Overall the net change in cash balance is maintained at a positive number in the last year depicting that the company can turn out to be profitable in the market in the long run.
From the statistical report of the financial figures shown in the table, we can draw a conclusion about the company's net progress over the years. The year 2020 saw a major downfall in the net profit margin of the company when the net profit margin touched 9.79%. Revenues dipped by a slight value as well in 2021. The company seems to have been going through a rough time as is evident from the EBITDA values that point to a decreased operational efficiency in the past year. The company might not have had the necessary market required to sell across its product to the customers. However post 2021 the company is slowly progressing towards attaining a higher profit margin. It is imperative to note that shareholders do not continue to enjoy benefits at a rate of -27.85 Rs. earnings per share from the company which is indeed a matter of concern.
The values depicts financial figures from the table which is a balance sheet of a company over the past 5 years. The company has excelled in revenue generation and has increased drastically in the year 2023 touching the 5893 Cr. Rs. mark. The current assets of the company seems to be on the rise which means that the company has seen enough of liquidity improvement in the given span of time. The book value of the company has witnessed steep upsurge in 2023 when it reached the mark of 153.78 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had been going through a good time in handling its liabilities and had escalated its financial situation. In recent years, the scenario has seen marked improvement and is in a much stable state.
The opening cash balance of the company shows approximately average trends untill 2022 followed by a steep decline in 2023. It is seen that the company revenues have gone up till 2022 which might point to an increased market value. As a result, it has been able to maintain better rates of net cash balance in the initial years. As per the current trends, the company has incurred a number of excess expenditures and has been performing impressively in managing its financial assets. It has thus been able to maintain a profitable net cash balance of 260.21 Cr. Rs. which is a mark of positivity for its future growth.
The table depicts the highs and lows of the company in the past 2 years in terms of its financial numbers. It has been performing poorly in maintaining its operational efficiency over the years which hints at the fact that the company has not been judiciously investing on its strategies and management plans. The operating profit margin is on the decline, it has not been able to maintain an equilibrium growth in its net profit margin too. In the year 2023, the earnings per share faced a severe low of -4.66 Rs. which increases the need for the company to enhance the numbers strategically. Thus it needs to be making gradual improvements to ensure the stability of the company and to gain a good trust of its prospective investors.
It is remarkable from the given balance sheet of the company that there has been a significant decrease in the total revenue generation of the company in the year 2023. The company has, as a result, witnessed a degradation in the total asset value in 2023. Current assets of the company are fairly increasing which removes the doubt that the company needs to work on maintaining a short term in hand cash flow in order to support its operating activities. The total liabilities of the company have increased with time which needs to be remediated. There has been significant decline in the total equity possessed by the company which is a negative sign for the company in the long run. It has been able to maintain the stock on a consistent range and can thus gain the confidence and support of investors.
The revenue curve for the company data displayed is an increasing graph between 2020-2023. The expenses show a similar trend in values. The company had faced a tremendous fall in the year 2022 when its net profit margin dropped to 24.54% as opposed to the previous year value of 29.60%. Over the years from 2022, it has been able to pull up its socks and make a steady growth in its net profit margin. It has been showing commendable results in balancing its operating profit margin irrespective of the rising expenses. With earnings per share increasing in recent times, shareholders will be moved by the variation and shall make better profits. It will be worthwhile if the company is able to sustain this growth curve in the near future in order to have a stable hold in the market.
The table depicts the comparison of asset values of the company across three years and is a testament of the fact that the company has been performing efficiently in maintaining its equity levels but the book value has decreased by a huge margin in the last year. The liabilitiies have piled up and needs to be paid back in time to avoid crisis. Thus it is necessary for the company to generate revenues at a greater margin to elevate its financial figures at a better rate.
The values obtained from the table shown are indicative of the fluctuations in the cash flow trends of the company in the past two years which is a measure of the financial strength and stability of the company. While the company has been able to accumulate good margin of cash in 2022, it has gone down by a heavy margin in 2023. It has been able to maintain an upward growth in terms of the operating cash flow. It is a remarkable decline in the investment front that the company has witnessed. While the company has maintained a steady upward growth of cash flow generated from its financing activities, the numbers are still negative and a little effort would set the net change in cash to higher positive figures.
The table depicts the financial reports of a company in the last five years between 2019-2023. It is prominent that the company is definitely showing good progress over the years and has been able to maintain a sustainable value for its financial numbers. The company has made good enough revenues over the years with a steady rise and has been capable of balancing its expenses too. Thus, the net profit margin of the company is rising over the years with minor ups and downs. But its earnings per share values have seen a gradual decline from 46.12 Rs. in 2019 to 23.81 Rs. in 2023. Investors can look forward to future prospects with this company as the dividends per share values are on the rise too.
The gradual upward variation in the net total assets of the company as observed from the balance statement sheet is a mark of fair financial stability for the company in the years 2020-2023. The company has a lot of liquid assets withstanding against its name. The equity of the company has touched the 3707 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2023 which highlights the effective business strategies that allows it to purchase assets at a lower cost. The book value of the company has shown decline in the year 2022 touching 92.61 Cr. Rs. post which the company steadily regained hold of its financial strength and escalated the book value to 108.45 Cr. Rs. The common stock values have also been on an average range and is consistent over the years which ensures that company will draw the eye of shareholders rapidly.
The data fetched from the table shows concerning numbers of the net change in cash as the company seems to have touched the -83.86 Cr. Rs. mark as of 2021. This highlights a dropdown in the company profits and can pose a risk in the path of sustainable growth. The opening cash balance of the company has seen ups and downs over the years but have been on the positive side, so it is worth saying that the company is doing moderately fine in terms of revenue generation every consistent year. The positive value of cash flow generated from operating activities depicts that the company has been able to accumulate cash from its prominent operations on a daily basis and is on the positive side. A lot of work is still needed on the investment front as the cash from investing activities is on the decline. This emphasises the need to reform its investment plans to maintain a higher net change in cash which is running at negative numbers since the past  year.
The data obtained from the table clearly reveals that the company has been excelling over the years to make a stable proifit margin. The revenues have been progressing with higher positive numbers. The growth in profit in the last 2 years has been slow and gradual, but it is noteworthy that the company has recovered itself from the state of loss. It has also been able to maintain a steady range of net operational margin over the years. There can be no questions on the operational efficiency of the company though as is evident from growing values of EBITDA 2022 onwards. Shareholders can hold some hope as the earnings per share of the company seem to have risen in the past 2 years as compared to the negative range it was initially in.
The balance statement sheet of the given company is a depiction of the overall worth of the company and can help determine its current financial stability. The given table gives a clear picture of a marked increase in the total assets owned by the company in the year 2023, which means that the company had enough resources to fund itself that year. There is a greater scope of potential growth with no lack of monetary stability which is a boon to fund the operations of the company. The liabilities of the company had significantly decreased in the year 2021 reaching 900.81 Cr. Rs. which represents that the company had less debt to finance its operations efficiently. Thus the obligations of the company in recent years has slightly increased and the current liabilities have touched the 493.96 Cr. Rs. mark. A positive outlook of the company is presented by the steady growth of equity over the years which might have resulted from selling shares of stocks. Thus the company has grown significantly over the period and is in a stable position in the rapidly developing market.
The information deciphered from the table shed light on the cash flow records of a company in the span of 2019-2023. The net change in cash in the last year has escalated by a positive margin from a bottom line of -198.74 Cr. Rs. which instills some hope on the stability of the company in the future. A strict eye needs to be kept on the declining rate of cash flow generated from investing activities and the company needs to put a hold on deinvestments. The same trend is observed in cashflow from financial activities which had shown more profitable numbers in the year 2022 but is gradually seen to be dropping down.
It is clearly visible from the table that the financial reports of the company have proved to be lucrative enough for its investors and will attract shareholders likewise. The company has been maintaining steady growth in revenues over the years but has been a victim of an imbalance in the higher rate of increasing overhead costs and expenditires. As a result what follows is sheer loss and the company net profit margin has been on the decline as is seen in 2022. Though the compaany has performed a little better in the year 2023 comparitively, its net profit can have better future prospects. The same trend is observed in its operational and functional efficiency as a result of which it is imperative to conclude that the company is making gradual upward growth.
The revene generated by the company has enabled the company to fund for itself and increase the total assets of the company over the years with a little deviation in the year 2020 and 2022. The liabilities have been toned down , otherwise it can lead to a state of loss for the company and it might run into debt. Handling this should be the prime focus of the company at this stage. Common stock values have seen a subtle decline in recent years and the company should look forward to gaining the confidence of its investors better with a decreasing debt to equity and higher book value of 719.71 Cr. Rs.
The records of cash flow as seen in the table show mixed numbers and throws light on the ups and downs faced by the company in the past 5 years. The company made a prominent start in 2019 with an opening balance of 878.67 Cr. Rs. With time, it has been capable of generating core operational profit which is crucial for sustaining the company in the long run. Since the returns from investment have not been very attractive in 2021-2022, the impact of the same is seen in the overall net change in cash. As of 2023, the company seems to have undergone amendments of its functional and market strategies to strengthen its financial power touching a net balance of 1120 Cr. Rs.
A striking point to be observed from the given table is the increase in the company's net profit margin in the year 2021. Profit margin increased from -14.02% to 12.61%  and shows signs of advancement of the company. The revenues are at par with the growth of the company and it is evident that in recent years the company has been performing better than before. Efficiency in operational aspects have also taken a sudden hike in 2021 and is indicative of upcoming future prospects of the company to strengthen its working proficiency. Currently the company is at a lucrative state for shareholders and investors  and shows signs of betterment in the future.
From the given table, transitions in asset management trends that the company has witnessed in the last five years is quite prominent. The company does not owe some significant amount to repay to its creditors. The count of liabilities need to be curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been growing in the same range which might be a part of the companies future growth investment. The total equity of the company has a massive rise in the last one year touching 9896 Cr. Rs. , and is a positive sign for all its shareholders. The debt to equity values of the company has seen negligible numbers which throws light on the fact that the company does not owe money to other businesses. This number needs to be maintained in the long run.
It is clear from the given table that the company is not doing well in terms of maintaining a steady cash flow from operating activities, and requires significant enhancement in strategies in order to streamline cash flows generated from investing activities. The net change in cash flow had dropped in the year 2022 to a negative value which might indicate the impact of excess losses or the state of debt the company has been in. It is also to be noted that the opening cash flow of the company has been maxmum in the year 2021 where it touched 9793 Cr. Rs. post which which it has gradually fallen down. Thus the revenue curve of the company also needs to be monitored.
The company data from the table shows a beautifully rising revenue growth curve in the past 4 years with the company touching 1981 Cr. Rs. revenue in the year 2023. The operating profit margin faced slow growth until 2021 post which it has been seen to be slowly declining. While shareholders have found a good deal with this company, it needs to be monitored for future variations in numbers. Overall net profit margin has been actively maintained by the company and shows minor variations. It is imperative that the company balances its revenues and its expenses in order to generate an upward profit margin with time.
The data generated from the table throw light on the trend in balance statement parameters of a particular company. The company has been in a minor state of debt which has increased with time and definitely needs to be cut down. It has thus been able to increase its production and efficiency. The total asset values have seen a gradual increase over the years. Hand in hand, total liabilities have also increased with time and it is a felt need of the hour to mitigate these values. Failing to compensate for these might let the company into a state of loss. Stock prices of the company have been in an overall consistent range as a result of which the company has been making profit and has been able to win the trust of shareholders. A noticeable fact is that the company has gone down in its book value over the years which needs to be revived for a better financial stability of the company.
Summing up the observations from the table, we see that the company has been declining with an opening cash balance all throughout the years. It had tried to get over the uncleared debts and make a moderate improvement in financial activities in 2022 but has touched down the -4.85 Cr. Rs. bottomline again. Thus the decline is more conspicuous in this case. It has been able to revamp its investment plans a little in the past one year as a result of which the cash flow from investing activities has become a little better in the past year, but it has a lot of efforts to be made in order to neutralise the net negative change in cash and strengthen its financial assets. The year 2023 has seen a higher margin of net cash balance due to improved operational efficiency of the company and provides an optimistic view.
The statistics shown in the above table highlight the financial figures of the company in the past five years. The company has been performing exceptionally well in maintaining an overall upward growth in its operational profit margin upto 2021 which is indespensable for the prosperity of the company in the long run. While the organisation faced a major decline in the net profit margin in the year 2021 when it touched -267.21%, it has been steadily catching up with the competitive market and has increased its profit margin by a certain margin. However it is still at a state of loss. The company's earnings per shares have also witnessed a massive decline reaching -135.64 Rs. from in 2021 and throws light on the fact that the company needs to put efforts to establish a good worth in the market.
The information drawn from the given table represents the balance sheet of a company and shows the huge financial progress made by the company in the past 5 years. The equity margin has seen steady upward growth from 2019 to 2021, finally touching 7329 Cr. Rs. in the year 2023. The company has faced a bloom in revenues and has been able to make a stable foothold in the market from its total assets worth. The debt to equity stands as low as 1.52 which depicts a reduction in the burden on the company to clear of excess cash that the company owes to other companies. Therefore it is needless to say that the company has been exhibiting a tremendous positive growth and will hopefully maintain this trend in the long run.
The values obtained from the picture displayed depict the five year performance of a company in terms of its financial records. The cash flow values from operating activities reflect that the company has been performing up to the mark in terms of its core operations in recent years which is essential for sustaining the day to day activities of the company. This gradual increase in cash flow is an important asset. While the cash flow from investing activities has also been on the negative side, it is evident that the company has involved itself in excess capital expenditures and hence its current expenses need to be cut off. The company has shown exceptional performance in maintaining a positive increase in cash flow obtained from operating activities. The net change in cash overall has been on the negative side as of 2023 touching -168.86 Cr. Rs. which raises concerns on the financial stability and future growth of the company.
The data obtained from the table reflects a mixed variation over the five years in terms of financial stability of the company. The revenue data shows an upward graph. It is notable that the operating profit margin of the company has decreased conspicuously in 2021 and has been on the increase till date. This might eye to a cut down of its management costs or cost of labour. Since operational efficiency has increased as is evident from the EBITDA values, there is no need for reconstruction of its ideas to channelise the company and its growth in the upward direction. The company faced a bad time in the year 2021 and has seen a decrease in its earnings per share. However, with the sudden surge in eps value to 201.60 Rs, it has been able to increase its net value and settle in the existing market.
With a sheer positive growth in total asset values, the company has exhibited an extraordinary performance in the year 2023 when its total assets have touched the 1807 Cr. Rs. mark. The company also has enough of inflowing cash to cover up its short term prospects and make a stable operational environment in the company. With the book value and stock values making a significant rise, the company is ready to gain investors to fund itself in the upcoming days.
From the table given above we see a comparison in the cash flow parameters of a company over the years 2019-2023. The opening cash balance of the company has gone down in the year 2021 followed by a simultaneous decrease in cash flow from operating activities. This is a proof that the company had not been able to make good profit from its core functions which is essential for maintaining an equilibrium in day-to-day financial activities. The investing activities have not generated much cash in the years which lays emphasis on the fact that the company might have made too many divestments or significant capital expenditures. The negative values of cash flow through financial activities also mean that the company might be under debt for a short period of time. Overall the net change in cash balance has been maintained at a positive number in 2023 and hints that the company can turn out to be profitable in the market in the long run.

The count of liabilities need to be curtailed as the company might resort to a state of risk if this continues. The non current liabilities of the company have been on the rise which might be a part of the companies future growth and investment strategy.

It highlights the high amount of cash generated from the company's core operations. The cash flow from investing activities has touched the negative mark and is on the decline with every passing year. It is essential that the company reconsiders its investment strategies or pushes itself to curtail excess investment for a particular time. The amount of cash generated by the company from stocks and other resources had gone down in the year 2021 when it touched -109.60 Cr. Rs. However the current value as of 2023 stands at -78.51 Cr. Rs. which is a betterment on the repayment of debts.

Rs.
The financial reports of the company from the given table show variation and ups and downs in numbers. Over the years from 2021-2022 the company has been maintaining  its revenues in the same range. Expenses have increased proportionally and so has the net profit. In the year 2019, the company has witnessed a slight dip in the net profit range and consequently its operating margin. However the increase in the value of earnings per share from 2.64 Rs. in 2019 to 13.78 Rs. in 2023 gives some hope for shareholders and investors about the future prospects of the company.
The data seen above shows that the compnay had faced slight challenges in maintaining an upward growth and financial stability in the year 2019 when its equity value touched the mark of 6423 Cr. Rs. Ever since, it has been a centre of attraction for shareholders and investors as the total assets along with the book values of the company have been constantly on the rise. Thus, it is a good prospect to hold shares in this company as the company is heading slowly to reach higher levels of glory.
It is significant to note from the given table that the company has been performing with minor ups and downs in the past 5 years between 2019 to 2023. While the opening cash balance has risen as of 2022 to 6320 Cr. Rs., the cash flow from operating activities that has been generated over the years also shows a positive trend. The company has been making better investment deals as of 2023 which is evident from the cash flow from investing activities as it denotes a slight improved number. Carefully observing, in the previous years the company might have spent excess on investments which could not finally bear any fruit. The cash flow from financial activities also signals cash obtained from stock purchases and other external buys. The net change in cash value over the last four years show drastic fluctuation with negative values in the year 2022 and 2023 which might indicate that the company had been going through a rough time. As per the latest trend observed, net change in cash in 2023 stands at -231.04 Cr. Rs. which is a heavy loss to the company.

The earnings per share of the value has touched down to 4.04 Rs. as of 2023 which is a matter of concern. Revenue generation has been in full swing over the years and has touched the highest point in 2023 at 4518 Cr. Rs.  While expenses have risen to and peaked in 2023 at 4221 Cr. Rs. the company has not been capable of balancing the numbers resulting in a profitable state. Thus, the company might continue to flourish in the market with sheer prosperity only if proper measures are taken.
The metrics fetched from the given balance sheet is indicative of the steady upward development of the company in the years 2021-2023. The burning rate of total asset value improvement indicates the marked probability that the company is keen on its revenue strategies and has been able to keep up with the developing market. However it is a key point that the book value of the company has gone done by some margin over the year 2021 reaching 50.59 Cr. Rs. This needs to be analysed as it might hint to a fluctuating market scenario or likewise. Stock rates of this company have been maintained which is a parameter that might attract shareholders in the long run if this trend persists.
The picture gives us the financial values of cash flow data for a particular company during the year 2019 to 2023. The opening cash balance of the company has gone down gradually with time in the past 3 years showing that the revenues of the company are on the decline. The company is making enough cash flow from its daily operations which is essential for sustaining the day-to-day activities. It is to be noted that the cash flow from financial activities have seen a rise from 2019 onwards and has increased by some margin in the past year when it touched -28.94 Cr. Rs. The values signal cash raised from financing sources which might include from issued stocks or from borrowing. Hence the company is not at a highly profitable position as it is still in debt. Financial standards of the company can be further upgraded if the company pushes brakes on investments that do not bear an equilibrium return. This will prevent the cash flow from investing activities touch the negative mark. On an average the company has seen a net negative change in cash value over the past 3 years which needs to be altered at the earliest.
A mark of optimism for all shareholders of this company is the fact that the profitability and earnings per share of the company have significantly increased from -2.41 Rs. in 2019 to 7.99 Rs. in 2023. This proves the future financial stability of the company and needs to be monitored in the long run. Revenue has increased over the years by a good margin. Expenses have increased hand in hand and has been curtailed in order to increase the net profit margin. The efficiency of its workforce has been maintained over the years and is a positive sign. Overall, the data shown is imperative to the idea that the company makes reorganisational steps to reduce its overheads and in turn, amplify its profits.
The rise in assets of the company over the years denotes a marked sense of prosperity for the company as it indicates that the company has been trying to expand its ventures and gain hold of more and more assets. As of 2023, the total assets of the company have touched the 1557 Cr. Rs. mark and have enough financial stability so as to not depend on external investors or companies for its operational activities. The total liabilities of the company have seen a dip in the year 2021 when it touched the 193.52 Cr. Rs. base which denotes that the company had been working on loan repayments and clearing off liabilities to its creditors. The company has the sheer support of investing firms as its stock values are constantly on the same range and its book value has also shown remarkable enhancement in 2023 touching 102.31 Cr. Rs.
The year 2020 has witnessed a drastic decline of the company as the net change in cash flow values had touched the negative number bottom line of -18.92 Cr. Rs. Just at the same instance, the cash flow from operating activities had also touched -218.55 Cr. Rs. As a result the net closing balance of the company could not add up well. In the past 5 years the company has been trying hard to maintain a positive value of operating activities cash flow which indicates that the company is making some money from its core operations, which will help it to sustain the day to day activities. The company needs to push brakes on investment and try to compensate for the losses incurred due to fairly declining value of cash from investing activities. It is a positive aspect that the net change in cash value had risen up as of 2021 but is seen on the decline in 2023 again at -12.94 Cr. Rs. It would be beneficial for the company to maintain a growth in these numbers in the upcoming years.
